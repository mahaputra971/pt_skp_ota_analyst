Wahyu,Indonesia,Superior Triple,1,10.0,"Lokasi bagus dekat pantai, fasilitas oke, ada kolam renang, staff sangat ramah dan membantu","December 31, 2025"
paul,Australia,Standard Double Room with Fan,2,8.8,"If you want a getaway from it all place, this is it. It’s a surfer beach with a handful of warungs, bars and hotel restaurants. Most are perched on cliffs overlooking the sparkling black sands. The nearby area has no mini-marts or money changers, so come prepared if you are a cash person like me. Hotel Gubug has a great pool and a friendly staffed bar and restaurant. Rooms are basic but adequate. If you are a 5 star honcho then spend your mega bucks elsewhere, but for me who wanted a getaway, this is perfect…","December 08, 2025"

Jon,Australia,Standard Double Room with Fan,22,10.0,Excellent location. Great place to stay.,"November 14, 2022"
Amethyst,Australia,Superior Triple,1,9.2,"They have clearly been reading reviews and taken on feedback. Rooms come with a fridge now, and the pool they have built has a stunning view of the surf break. 
Rooms are quiet (each room
building is individual), well sealed so mosquitos weren’t an issue, clean and fresh linen daily. Photos don’t do justice. 
The garden is tended to daily and is mature and lovely. All rooms face the ocean (we stayed in 11 and could see the surf from bed.) And it’s all only 1 minute walk to the beach. 
Definitely the best value for money for well-equipped room, and best pool in Balian. 
Unfortunately the restaurant hadn’t  reopened since covid when we visited, but hopefully it does in the future as I heard from return travellers it was the best in town.","September 28, 2022"
Wayne,Australia,Standard Double Room with Fan,7,7.2,Great location but rooms need refurbishment,"September 14, 2022"

Andrea,Australia,Superior Triple,3,9.6,"Stayed in room 10 with ocean views and it was better than expected regarding other peoples photos. Room was spacious and just needed a fridge. Staff left you alone, which I don't  have a problem with. Great pool with ocean views.. ample breakfast... good location short distance to some good warungs for food, juice and ofc bintangs..","October 29, 2017"
sue,Australia,Superior Triple,3,9.2,"Lovely place to stay, with the best view. We stayed upstairs for the view for $5 more, but when we got there , we could've stayed below as the view was great from down stairs also. Rooms aren't very big but big enough!! . There is a double and a single bed. We would wake up to a beautiful view from the bed each morning. There is no kettle or fridge in the room.
Breakfast was basic but very tasty. The garden is beautiful  which gives the hotel a lovely feel. There are lots of restaurants nearby and a lovely coffee shop just on road behind hotel, that make the best coffee!! There isn't a great deal todo in Balian but chill,. It was wonderful to get out of the busy part of Bali. This place is a gem! and so quiet, but Balian is getting busy so I want to enjoy it before it changes.
I definitely will back again next year. My only issue is the beds are very hard and the pool is too strong with chemicals which made swimming uncomfortable and burnt my eyes, but I did mention it so ...","September 16, 2016"
Anthony,Australia,Superior Triple,5,9.2,"Comfortable room, staff were helpful and friendly, great location, I'll be back","August 27, 2016"
Stephen,United Kingdom,Superior Triple,1,9.2,"Great view, staff. Breakfast could be better and bring your own pillow but the view is to die for and the pool is lovely. I'd stay again.","July 16, 2016"
Luke,Australia,Superior Triple,4,9.6,"First thing you notice is that the photos online don't do it justice. Their garden is beautiful and fully grown! The staff are friendly and helpful and caring. The room itself has a very comfortable queen bed and 2 great puffy pillows!! :) Air con was new unit and worked well. The bathroom was the only part holding it back from better rating. Toilet was right next to shower which was a simple shower head on a hose attached to the wall. Nonetheless the water was hot and quickly too even though you preferred the cool water :p Only provided soap so you might want to bring shampoo.
Wifi was decent reception but drop outs happened a lot so no online calls but everything was good :)
Definitely going back there. For the price that included breakfast and the location was perfect. Plus the pool over looking the beach was brilliant to chill by after big surf sessions.","June 24, 2016"
Michaela,Australia,N/A,4,7.7,"Location was excellent, good relaxing spot by the pool over looking the ocean, aircon wasn't as cold as we would have liked it to be, bed was very loud, also no hot water but didn't bother us as it was always hot!! Would stay again though, great price!","January 28, 2015"
Heather,United States,N/A,2,8.7,"The staff at Gubug are very caring and helpful. The location is great - maybe 30 meters from the bottom of the road to the beach. There are about 3 single rooms and 6 two-storey rooms arranged in an L-shape.  Rooms are pretty new. My only issue is that the room I had (room 1) was really dark. The floor covering and walls are all dark tile and brick throughout. The lighting is poor. Without opening the front window curtains, there is very little light in this room. Made if difficult to get ready for the wedding I was attending. Other than that it was comfortable, safe, and a nice place to stay. They are building a pool at the moment that will be an infinity pool overlooking the ocean. That will be a great addition to this hotel.","October 29, 2014"
Angel,Spain,Superior Triple,1,9.6,"Amazing place , If you are looking for a quiet place to surf and relax away from the fuss of Bali, come here, I recommend staying in the triple room with sea views, it has air conditioning and a fridge . Plus the seaviews with the pool, the sunset... You can rent a motorcycle in the same place, on the main road you have some small markets and ATMs…I’ll back for sure","January 05, 2024"

I would definitively advice you to come here !","January 10, 2024"
Sylvie,France,N/A,3,4.7,"La photo sur internet ne mentait pas, la vue sur l'océan est époustouflante. Mais ma chambre était sale, le robinet de la douche bloqué par le calcaire notamment. J'ai pris ma douche avec des tongues... Je suppose que les occupants précédents de la chambre étaient un troupeau d'éléphants en entrainement de saut au trampoline vu l'état de la literie.
Certes, j'avais choisi un établissement simple, mais simplicité ne rime pas forcément avec saleté","May 26, 2015"
