Troy,Australia,1 Bedroom Sea View,1,10.0,"Stayed 2 nights, great place to stay. Rooms are amazing & clean with everything you need. Good restaurant, the grounds & pool are truly beautiful especially for an early morning swim & then breakfast by pool. There are many cute restaurants nearby for other choices of food. The staff are beautiful but sometimes  little unorganised however it's not a big deal. Just go with the flow & enjoy it. I will stay again.  👍","September 05, 2025"
william,Canada,2-Bedroom Garden View Villa,12,9.6,What an amazing spot . I was not sure of the location being two hours north west of the airport . But this is Bali’s little secret spot !!! It was the most beautiful spot with wildlife and amazing views . The staff was amazing and the prices was perfect .  We were walking distance to the Balian beach with wonderful beaches and surfing . We had the pool almost to our self’! We experienced great restaurants both at the hotel and down by the beach . I would not stay anywhere else . Thank you for a wonderful vacation and 12 days of bliss !!,"January 03, 2026"
Lanelyn,Philippines,Honeymoon Villa,3,10.0,"We had Honeymoon Villa10 and has excellent ocean view. Wide and clean room, staff are friendly and food is very good. Recommended to people who wants to have a relaxing days and loves nature. You will hear the sound of the waves 24/7 but not disturbing. Excellent wifi connection and they have netflex and more. Just you can’t swim at the beach infront. You must go to Balian beach or other beaches you preferred  which is recommended and is just 10 minutes walking from the hotel. We will come back again. We had a wonderful stay.","January 21, 2025"
John,Australia,Honeymoon Villa,4,9.2,"Had a wonderful 4 nights here. A truly authentic Balinese feel. The bungalow was spacious and well appointed with an incredible ocean view. Staff were friendly and kind. It is a serene private oasis. Not everyone will love the old school Bali  atmosphere, but the private bay and lush surroundings was a perfect escape for us. Recommended for anyone who wants to detox and feel the traditional Balinese atmosphere","November 15, 2025"
Francoise,Indonesia,Honeymoon Villa,1,8.0,"It’s our second time staying in this resort, we loved the garden villa but this time we decided to try the honeymoon villa which is closer to the cove. Unfortunately the waves were so loud, we couldn’t sleep. There were frogs in our room. It’s the wrong season to come I guess as it was rainy with thunders.  The restaurant staff are always so friendly and nice.  I think next time we will stick to the garden villa, much quieter and peaceful.","November 14, 2025"
Kara,Australia,1-Bedroom Garden View Villa,2,9.6,"loved the lush oasis sanctuary that is this whole property. My own private villa, with an outdoor shower and rooms that feel like they’re from biblical times, made from stone. Amazing!

The bed was so comfy, and the linen was amazing. They also provided soap, shampoo, and conditioner, which was a nice touch.

The pool is incredible, and the private beach and caves are equally stunning. The property is just up the hill from the main food spots and Balian Beach.

You can hear the ocean and birds chirping all day long. It's truly magical.

One thing that wasn’t a major issue but worth mentioning: I had some problems with my sliding door. When I first arrived, it wouldn’t lock, but they fixed it straight away. On the second day, the door came off the tracks and wouldn’t shut—a different issue—but they fixed it again promptly. The staff were very friendly throughout.

They also helped me arrange a bike rental and a car to my next destination. I would definitely recommend this place.","August 24, 2024"
Agus,Indonesia,1-Bedroom Garden View Villa,1,9.2,"Pro: great location, great view, great facility despite old
Cons: dirty, not very very dirty, but because it was less occupied, so that the room was not really clean, as we expected before. Restaurant menu was bad, or meaning to say Never chose break fast package. For your info, other hotel surrounding area got so much better break fast package. During our stay, there was construction at pool and restaurants, so we were unlucky. I hope this place is getting better. Thanks.   4/5 is okay for us ya. I am Agus and my wife is Daria. Thanks.","May 26, 2023"
Francoise,Indonesia,1-Bedroom Garden View Villa,1,8.8,"The villas were spacious so we can’t hear the neighbors, very quiet surroundings, far the roads. If you are looking for a quiet place to retreat, this is where to go. The food was okay, nothing specia but still good.","October 16, 2025"
Rita,Indonesia,Honeymoon Villa,4,9.6,For honeymoon room too far from lobby and dark no lamp. Need light. Too many house lizard and sometime they pup in ur bed. Before AC not cold but after complain they fix it and now cold. Thanks for helpful from the staff,"December 31, 2025"
Alan,United States,1 Bedroom Sea View,1,7.6,"We were doing a road trip around Bali and booked this place without knowing anything about it.  First, it was a little difficult to find.
Second, there is a LONG walk from where we park the bike to the room. Luckily we caught a break in the rain or it would have been miserable.
The place is older and a little run down.  It became clear that many of the best photos were from an earlier time where all the facilities were still maintained.
The location itself is very interesting: basically two tall cliffs that jut out into the ocean with a narrow little beach between them.  So it feel very private and secluded.  You can walk up to the outermost point on each cliff and you get great vistas of the ocean and distance beach-line.  But all the facilities up there are basically abandoned.  One side looked like it was once a spa, the other side has covered picnic tables, but everything is broken and falling apart.
Other aspects of the grounds were cute and interesting.  Old statues, little walkways, pretty lighting, etc.

The room itself was fine, bed and pillows great.  There is a restaurant on premises and it is basically the only food option.  It was ok, but not super exciting.","October 03, 2024"
Meity,Indonesia,1-Bedroom Garden View Villa,2,10.0,"Staying at Gajah Mina Resort made the kids happy, the staff and facilities there are very good. The view facing the beach made our family feel entertained by the beautiful scenery of the beach. Next, we will go back there again.",N/A
Liudmila,Indonesia,1-Bedroom Garden View Villa,3,8.4,"I had a wonderful stay at Gajah Mina Resort in Balian! The property itself is beautiful and peaceful, and my bungalow was clean and comfortable. 
However, I did notice that the staff seemed a bit understaffed, especially in the restaurant, which sometimes resulted in longer wait times. Despite this, I still enjoyed my stay and would recommend this resort to anyone visiting Balian.","April 08, 2023"
Matthew,Guam,Honeymoon Villa,2,10.0,We really enjoyed our quick stay at the hotel. It was very quiet and definitely off the beaten path. The staff were extremely helpful with getting us a driver when we needed.,"July 21, 2025"
Ayom,Indonesia,Honeymoon Villa,1,8.0,"Sebenarnya hotel ini bagus, mungkin manajemennya aja yang perlu lebih profesional sehingga perawatan lingkungannya bisa maksimal sehingga kesan cantiknya bisa maksimal. Tapi overall saya sekeluarga ok dengan suasananya. Memang jalan ke lokasinya agak sempit tapi aman dan bagus jalannya, cuma lobby ke kamar suite nya jauh banget jalannya, tapi kamarnya luas dan nyaman","April 09, 2025"
Kathy,United States,1 Bedroom Sea View,1,9.6,"Booked for two nights and stayed for 2 more. Loved the whole extended property. Each room is its own house with a separate inside bathroom and outside totally private shower. No bugs or critters and WiFi worked great in bungalow #7. And of course A/C.  They have a huge pool with lounge chairs and umbrellas. A restaurant below with inside and out side dining. Breakfast is included. The food was delicious. Fresh vegetables etc. The service was friendly but sparse. Depending if others are dining there (open to the public) prepare to wait close to an hour for your dinner to arrive. They need more wait and cook staff. But still-don’t forget to tip the waiter! He works hard.  There is a secret beach that you can climb down to but the waves were too strong for me to swim in. They have this great massage house on the cliff overlooking the ocean with great breezes. The masseuse is fantastic and for 200,000 rp you can get a hot stone hour and a half massage. Quiet and peaceful- never needed to leave the premises. Book with Agoda- half the price!","February 28, 2023"
Luke,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Sea View,1,8.0,Nice location. first time we stayed amazing but second time there was no toothbrush and the water pressure in the shower was super low. Pool is really nice and no one there also semi private beach.,"August 31, 2025"
Lindsay,Singapore,1 Bedroom Sea View,2,9.6,"The resort is right next to a private secluded beach, so you have all the privacy you want. The sea view from sea view bungalow is very limited, but you can enjoy it at the restaurant. Food is great! But you should pre-order if you need to follow certain schedule as the service could be slow. 

The room is really big, with spacious toilet too. Love the outdoor shower, as it feels free. 

No mosquitos! We are surrounded by greeneries, but none of it. They take good care of this point. Other bugs will still be there, but minimal. Overall, a great stay and highly recommend","June 29, 2023"
Jason,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Sea View,1,6.8,"This resort has a lot of potential but there are areas that can be improved upon.  At the end of the day, you get what you pay for and this resort offers tons for the $.

Pros: 
Inexpensive, nice rooms, excellent/tasty food, friendly staff, and views of the ocean.  

Cons: 
The speed of service is poor. We ordered dinner and it took over an hour (no exaggeration) to receive our food, and my family were the only guests within the restaurant.     

Our room included breakfast (which was tasty), but the staff person taking our order was incompetent.  I can speak Indonesian, so there was no language barrier or confusion.  But he was not properly trained.  

Long story short, it took 65 minutes (not joking) for us to receive our breakfast and we were the only guests at breakfast. When I would inquire about our meal, the staff responded by saying ""Sorry that it's taking a long time"".  

Also, the shampoo and body wash within the shower were Not usable.  These containers sit outside in the heat of the sun, which causes the shampoo and body was to became like a thick gel (unusable).  


The property is big and has a lots of potential, but needs improvement with landscaping maintenance, and a better path to the private beach. The current beach trekking path is overgrown and difficult to reach.  Unfortunately, we could access the beach which was going to be the highlight of our stay.","December 23, 2022"
Yunus,Indonesia,2-Bedroom Garden View Villa,1,10.0,"The resort is located at the end of the road, and cars can enter and park directly in front of it. We stayed in a 2-bedroom villa, which is very spacious with a typical Javanese/Balinese home atmosphere.

The restaurant faces the sea, so while having breakfast, you can enjoy the view of the ocean. The fried noodles and toast are delicious.",N/A

But during all 5 days the air-conditioning is our room could not be repaired and was really tough we sleep. Little kitchen in the roof is outdated and can't be used. This place generally has a great potential but should be renovated.","February 04, 2024"
Katrin,Australia,2-Bedroom Ocean View,3,6.8,"We booked the 2 bedroom cottage with ocean view, but when we arrived there were 2 separate one bedroom cottage next to each other.

My room was covered in dust and spiderweb, in the bathroom lime spots everywhere, mirrors and windows seemed not to be cleaned for years.
I have allergy on dust and in minutes, I was covered in red itchy rush.
There were nobody to help me with the room, except security guard. He shows me another room that was covered in mouse poop all over the floor. I had to sleep in because it was too late to move somewhere else.

Theseus,Australia,1 Bedroom Sea View,5,8.8,"Nothing's perfect, but Gajah Mina comes very close.

Just the most beautiful resort I've ever seen.","August 21, 2022"
Jennifer,United States,1 Bedroom Sea View,2,10.0,"So happy to be back at the splendid Gajah Mina! Such a unique and special place. Sitting on the veranda of our cottage listening to the waves crashing and birds chirping is one of the best ways to decompress. If you are looking for a place to completely unwind and find peace this is it. Surrounded by black sand beaches, nature and unlimited beauty, plus you never have to leave the grounds because the food here is delicious. Covid had been hard on Bali but Dominique and Yaning and staff have kept Gajah Mina going. We were so happy to be back and will be again next year!!","July 18, 2022"

Don't expect anything fancy but what you get is good. Literally on the beach and very close to beach restaurants and bars. Admitting it takes a bit of an effort (organised by the hotel) to get there but once you are there relax and enjoy. We are fam. with two small kids, they enjoyed it a lot, beach and pool what else do you need!","December 31, 2013"
William,United Kingdom,N/A,5,6.3,A good place to stay if you want to switch off and relax.  The food was delicious. It's miles from anywhere though so we would recommend hiring a car if you want to explore the area.   We have three small children and there was not much for them to do although the pool is nice and there are good beach walks.   My one criticism of the hotel was that there seemed to be a lack of management presence and some of the staff seemed unhappy/disinterested (very unusual for Bali where the service is usually excellent and always given with a smile).,"July 31, 2013"

Birgit,Germany,Honeymoon Suite Room,5,10.0,"Sehr schöne und ruhige Anlage mit ca 12 Bungalows in einem sehr großen Garten, 3 Bungalows (Honeymoonsuiten) mit direktem Blick auf das Meer. Das erste Hotel in Bali, in dem wir schneeweiße Handtücher und neue Bettwäsche hatten.  Zudem sind die Zimmer sehr geräumig, mit Klimaanlage und Fan, bequemes Bett, großes Bad mit sauberer Dusche, großer Badewanne und viel Ablagefläche.  An dem großen und gepflegtem Pool bekommt man immer freie Liegen. Das gesamte Hotel- und Restaurantpersonal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. 
Ein Highlight ist das Essen in dem kleinen Restaurant. Es wird alles frisch zubereitet, dauert zwar etwas länger, aber das Warten lohnt sich, alles schmeckt ausgezeichnet zu normalen Preisen. Zudem werden leckeres Brot und Kuchen selbst gebacken, Ravioli, Fettuchine, Bacon, Pesto, leckere Papayamarmelade und Eis sind ebenfalls homemade. Alle Gerichte werden liebevoll und mit frischen Kräutern angerichtet. Zum Frühstück gibt es eine Karte mit Auswahl verschiedener Gerichte, alles lecker und sehr reichlich. Auch unser erstes Hotel, in dem wir 6-7 verschiedene Früchte im Fruitsalad zum Frühstück bekommen haben. Trinkwasser kann man sich im Restaurant in jeder Menge auffüllen.
Von der Restaurantterrasse hat man einen herrlichen Blick auf die Secret Bay. Von  10 Pkt. vergeben wir an  Küche und Restaurant 12 Punkte. 

Über einen kleinen Naturweg läuft man ca 10 min zur Mejan Beach, wo man herrlich lange Strandwanderungen unternehmen kann. Im Ort gibt es Supermärkte und einen Nachtmarkt ( ca 20 min Fußweg).

Wir hatten 5 Nächte gebucht, haben uns aber so wohl gefühlt (trotz einiger Regentage), dass wir noch 3 Nächte verlängert haben und kommen in unserem nächsten Urlaub auf jeden Fall zurück ins Gajah Mina Beach Resort. Vielen Dank allen Angestellten für unseren schönen und erholsamen Aufenthalt.

Lampu di jalan setapak hotel banyak yang mati sehingga tamu butuh senter untuk jalan di malam hari. Banyak nyamuk, semut merah besar di area kamar sangat menggangu bagi kami yang membawa anak kecil","May 01, 2023"
yang,China,1-Bedroom Garden View Villa,5,7.6,性价比高，就是地点有点偏，离机场好远，如果要赶飞机的起码需要提早3小时开始出发去机场，其它的都不错，如果卫生再好一点就完美了😊,"November 17, 2023"

Odelia,Indonesia,Honeymoon Villa,1,3.2,"Seandainya terdapat pilihan tidak ada bintang saya kasi tidak ada bintang. Sangat tidak direkomendasikan.
1. Penerangan di semua area resort sangat minim, bahkan di sepanjang jalan menuju villa honeymoon-1 yang lokasinya di ujung paling dekat dengan pantai kondisi jalannya gelap tanpa penerangan sama sekali atau lampu-lampu dibiarkan mati.
2. Banyak semut masuk ke kamar, sampai naik ke tempat tidur.
3. Penanganan komplain sangat lamban.
4. Sulit untuk mendapatkan makanan dikarenakan lokasi resort sangat pelosok,
Sedangkan di resto ketersediaan jenis makanan sangat terbatas atau minim macamnya.
5. Sikat gigi dan pasta gigi tidak ada","December 30, 2022"

Makarik,Russia,1 Bedroom Sea View,3,8.4,"Отдыхали с 23 по 26 октября. Тихий отель на берегу океана. Людей мало, отдыхать комфортно. Маленькие виллы с душем на улице. При заезде были проблемы с кондиционером, после днем работает не сильно, вечером в ночь, хорошо работал. Интернет хороший, но не скоростной, работает. При отеле есть что покушать, но вкуснее кухня недалеко от отеля, есть несколько ресторанов так же на побережье в ходьбе 15 минут или на байке 2 минуты. Завтраки на 3, кофе растворимый, чай из пакетиков, лучше без завтраков, в других местах кушать. Территория у отеля хорошая, небольшая, но домики рассредоточены так, что комфортно находится там, никто никому не мешает. Про уборку спрашивают, если нужно, то убирают. Есть вода. Бассейн метров 15. Красивый вид из ресторана на океан. В окрестностях рисовые красивые поля и пальмовые рощи, если пройтись вдоль океана прогуляться, открываются красивые виды, людей очень мало. Есть место где занимаются сёрфингом. Фрукты рядом не купить. Есть продуктовые сетевые магазины. Отдых для тех кто любит тишину и спокойствие. Прекрасная массажистка и цены очень приемлемые. Рекомендосье.","October 28, 2024"
Алена,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Sea View,1,10.0,"Это по-настоящему тайная бухта:  море с большими волнами между скал, секретные тропы через пещеры с летучими мышами, безумно красивые тайные пляжи, о которых знают только местные, чёрный вулканический песок и невероятная красота. Я искренне советую это место всем – мы были в 10 разных отелях на Бали до этого (Карангасем, Амед, Гили, Ловина, Убуд), и я скажу точно: этот отель и его территория самые красивые, интересные, уникальные из всех, что мы видели. Всё можно построить, но природу и саму локацию победить невозможно: здесь она явно даёт отелю огромное преимущество перед всеми другими местами. Да, сам отель и его домики – прекрасные, по цене и комфорту (это действительно отдельные маленькие виллы по стоимости гостиничного номера) мы не нашли ничего лучше. Мы оставались там на пару ночей, но в итоге продлили на 2 недели )) Если приедем на Бали на пару месяцев снова – на весь срок останемся там. Однозначно советую всем","February 17, 2023"
Алена,Indonesia,Honeymoon Villa,1,10.0,"Уже писала отзыв про это место: мы оставались на пару ночей, но в итоге забронировали на 2 недели )) поэтому отзывы запрашивают на оба бронирования.
Место поистине лучшее из всех, что мы видели на Бали, а мы были на тот момент в 10 отелях как минимум, так как путешествуем.
В другом отзыве написала подробную рецензию на пребывание, спойлер: не думайте вообще, бронируйте номер (у них это целые отдельные виллы!!) и езжайте туда на длительный срок, это в действительности незабываемое место. И спросите у сотрудников, как пройти через пещеру с летучими мышами на секретный пляж !!)) Они не болтают об этом, но если попросить – расскажут ) снова спойлер: это ВАУ. Удачного путешествия !","February 17, 2023"

Mary,Malaysia,1-Bedroom Garden View Villa,1,9.2,"My villa was clean, cool and peaceful I absolutely loved staying here. The pool was lovely. The beach was empty most of the time which is exactly what I was looking for. Spot to watch sunset with a coconut. Really good value for money! Only downside was tricky location, I couldn't order a Grab or Gojek even from the main road. But otherwise I enjoyed it all!","October 25, 2023"
