We’re truly happy to hear you and your family felt at home here and enjoyed the atmosphere, details, and surfing lessons. We would of course love to welcome you back anytime! 💜🌸 Just to reassure you — our family oriented boutique hotel is owner-operated and managed, which is why we can give such personal attention and care. Rest assured, our wonderful team will always remain, as they are highly trained and dedicated to making every guest feel welcome. In fact, we were very honored to be awarded Most Welcoming Hotel in Bali 2024 by the APAC Insider Awards — recognition that truly belongs to our amazing staff and the care they show our guests. 🌺 Regarding the beach: Balian is first and foremost a surfing beach, and when the waves are big there can be strong dangerous rips. That’s why the sign is posted at the entry point to the beach. On calmer days with small waves, swimming is possible, but safety always comes first. The pebbles are sometimes exposed by larger swells, and at other times they’re fully covered by soft sand. If you’d like to swim, we’re always happy to advise on the conditions of the day. Many guests and all locals choose to enjoy swimming in the river when the surf is up! A much safer option! We truly appreciate your feedback and hope to see you and your family again soon at Istana Balian. 🌸 Warm regards, Komang & the Istana Balian Team 🙏🏼🌴🎋🌊 ✨ Proudly awarded Most Welcoming Hotel in Bali 2024 – APAC Insider Awards ✨"

Thank you for your review. We are confused you mention there wasn't a fridge, as we have a small fridge in every room at Istana Balian. This is stated in our booking reply from us when you book and they were all replaced with new fridges last year. We are looking into putting glass doors on all our showers. We have found in the past shower curtains are very difficult to clean and keep hiegenic for multiple guests back to back in all our rooms. Thanks again for pointing out your suggestion. We look fwd to your return next time in Bali. Thank you for the kind words 🙏🏼 Warm regards Komang 🙏🏼"

We have taken photos and videos but can not find how to post on this thread, so any one reading this post and our reply, you can contact us directly or via this platform and we would be happy to send them thru. The issue was a broken shower exhaust fan and a room that was vacant for 10 nights that caused the problem. However, the bathroom is now completely safe and has been renovated to a very high standard. The bedroom was stripped and cleaned thoroughly. And this accommodation is now ready for guest occupancy. We would like to point out if you stay with us, and have any issues, please tell us straight away, so we can fix any issues you may have, and in this case we would have moved the guest to another garden room or upgraded them to one of our 2 story villas that was available immediately. And on a finishing note, we have been renovating and upgrading Istana Balian for the past 14 months, and it has been a slow yet thorough process, as we are doing this whilst open, and fitting in with guest bookings so no disruptions whilst staying with us. Our 3 Garden rooms are very well received but these were last on the renovation priority list as we had no issues to tend to. Thank you. We all look fwd to welcoming you back to Istana Balian. Sincerely Komang and the Istana team. ***** Original reply. Hello Karina. Our sincere apologies. The mould issue had come as a complete shock to us and my staff when you checked out and told us of the serious issues in one of our garden rooms. You are 100% correct, the shower ceiling in the bathroom and the condition is unacceptable. We take full responsibility for this problem but did not realise the condition of the ceiling until you told us. We had multiple back to back guest bookings in that room before your arrival, a family and one child, and the other a single guy ( please check his review Leigh Styles ).. were most recent before you stayed, and there were not any issues when they were here. However, we checked everything after you told us of the issue and we closed the room straight away. Our builder found that the exhaust fan was not working and a moisture build up has occured with in the bamboo ceiling. When the last guest checked out there were no issues, but the room was vacant for 10 days before you checked in, and although the room was cleaned daily, and fresh laundered sheets and blanket were placed in the room, this 10 day time frame due to the severity of the problem, that affected the shower ceiling has spread thru the room as well, as the entry doors were closed, but the bathroom door was open for that period of time. You have pointed out we had an issue 5 months ago, and stated we did nothing to fix the problem, however the ceiling was replaced, the fan was cleaned and checked and we have not had any issues untill you reported the problem. So this problem is a very recent issue that went un noticed by our staff and manager, so we have put check list protocols in place and can honourably say this will not happen again. As we mentioned to you, we were about to renovate the garden rooms, however, this was not being done because of any problems, it was asthetical only. However due to this urgent problem, builders were arranged this morning and will be here tomorrow morning to completely open the ceiling, clean everything, dry everything and the room will not reopen till the job is professionally completed to very hygienic standard required. The exhaust fan will be replaced, everything will be treated and cleaned and a solid waterproof ceiling will be installed when everything is ready to finish this urgent repair and maintenance. We have held a meeting with all the staff today to discuss this oversight in not detecting this problem, which was caused by the broken exhaust fan. But the condition of the ceiling, and the fan not working should have been noticed, and we are all sincerely sorry and apologetic you had to deal with these issues. Thank you Karina. We will repost the update as soon as the repair is completed 🙏🏼 Sincerely Komang Dwipayanti Owner Istana Balian"
