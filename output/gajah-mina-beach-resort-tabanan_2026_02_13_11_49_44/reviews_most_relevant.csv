No issues in dining room regarding meal service. Lovely staff. I really liked having a large gecko as a room mate. disliked: Wi-Fi only available in bungalows, not in public areas.... Guests must refill their water bottles in the dining room. There is only one refilling station. Don't understand why these filling stations are not in each individual bungalow..... The accommodation is cheap but the food is expensive with large selection of western style foods and limited Balinese options - but it's good. Due to position of property you really need your own transport if you want to get something else..... The air conditioning in the room was good but when lying in bed the air flow is on my face. Tried redirecting airflow but the position is opposite bed. When trying to sleep, the air con is annoying so have to turn off. Then it gets hot during the night and have to turn back on. Then turn off again because the air flow is on my face/head.... The bed was 2 single beds pushed together so could not spread out in the bed. It was very uncomfortable in the middle.",1,0,

Cherie,Australia,Superior Room,4 nights,Couple,04-18-2025 00:00:00,"Rustic, quiet and simply amazing ! A couples paradise",10.0,en-us,"Well! Where do I start? We loved this place. It was a very quiet time of year, a bonus for us!! We have a villa that is close to the pool and the ocean view. This place is rustic, it's out of the way, and a hidden gem. It is value for money, quiet (apart from the ocean crashing on the cliffs at night and the beautiful sound of the birds and the insects). We stayed 7 nights. Now Balian is a very quiet place and there are a few different accomodations in the area, but not a great deal to choose from. We were there on our round Bali trip and I was looking for locations for my next retreat. It is a very quiet place. So if you are looking for busy, shopping, night life. Do not visit Balian. But those of you who love peace and quiet and want to get away from it all. Especially if you love surfing, then this little hideaway is for you. It definitely suits couples. We found some wonderful eating places in the area and there is a great restaurant on site, where you can have all your meals. They are rated for their food and the qualitiy. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to get away from it all and want a break that is nice and quiet. It is gorgeous and the swimming pool it amazing. There is a wondeful nature walk (really rustic) and it takes you down to a beach that you can walk for miles and see no one (it's all volcanic sand, so be prepared to get black feet lol).

Michael,Laos,Bungalow with Garden View,1 night,Family,02-09-2024 00:00:00,Resort with potential - if the management would care,2.0,en,"The resort is located on a scenic cliff area in a beautiful garden landscape, with lots of birds singing in the morning. The pool is long, nice and clean. The bungalows were nice and clean (apart from the occasional cockroach or other small wildlife) and the large double bed (made with two separate mattresses) was comfortable, hot shower and aircons were working well. The home-made bread for breakfast was nice. The staff was nice, as long as there were no issues to discuss/ resolve (see below). For the bungalows and the garden and cliff landscape with the small ‘private’ beach, I would give four to five stars, if the issues described below were not tarnishing the experience a bit.","We booked two bungalows through booking.com, and expected to pay the price agreed on there. We were then asked to pay an additional 2% credit card charge - something none of the other 15+ hotels we stayed during this trip charged. Next we were shown ‘our’ bungalows, described on booking.com as two room bungalows with a bedroom with a double bed, and a separate living room with a sofa bed. What we got were bungalows with only a single bedroom with one large bed (the 1.2 meter sofa in there can hardly be called a sofa bed). When we pointed out that we booked bungalows with a separate living room, we were simply told to contact booking.com if we have an issue with this booking… It appears to us that it would certainly be the hotel’s responsibility to make sure that the description on the booking platform matches what they actually provide. The price we paid for the bungalows is not too high for the single room bungalows, but if you expect a two-room bungalow with a bed in each room as advertised, and the response you get from the hotel is a sloppy “talk to booking.com if you are not happy”, than that is certainly not good. The drinking water provided in the room is chlorinated tap water. The choice for breakfast was very limited. Two slices of bread with butter and jam was the top choice. Check-out time is 11am. When we asked whether it would be possible to check out around 12, we were told that this is not possible. When we passed by those bungalows again at 1pm, both bungalows were still in the same state as when we left (the beds not made, rooms not cleaned, nobody there…). We saw one other guest in the resort the whole time we were there…","title: Resort with potential - if the management would care. liked: The resort is located on a scenic cliff area in a beautiful garden landscape, with lots of birds singing in the morning. The pool is long, nice and clean. The bungalows were nice and clean (apart from the occasional cockroach or other small wildlife) and the large double bed (made with two separate mattresses) was comfortable, hot shower and aircons were working well. The home-made bread for breakfast was nice. The staff was nice, as long as there were no issues to discuss/ resolve (see below). For the bungalows and the garden and cliff landscape with the small ‘private’ beach, I would give four to five stars, if the issues described below were not tarnishing the experience a bit. disliked: We booked two bungalows through booking.com, and expected to pay the price agreed on there. We were then asked to pay an additional 2% credit card charge - something none of the other 15+ hotels we stayed during this trip charged. Next we were shown ‘our’ bungalows, described on booking.com as two room bungalows with a bedroom with a double bed, and a separate living room with a sofa bed. What we got were bungalows with only a single bedroom with one large bed (the 1.2 meter sofa in there can hardly be called a sofa bed). When we pointed out that we booked bungalows with a separate living room, we were simply told to contact booking.com if we have an issue with this booking… It appears to us that it would certainly be the hotel’s responsibility to make sure that the description on the booking platform matches what they actually provide. The price we paid for the bungalows is not too high for the single room bungalows, but if you expect a two-room bungalow with a bed in each room as advertised, and the response you get from the hotel is a sloppy “talk to booking.com if you are not happy”, than that is certainly not good. The drinking water provided in the room is chlorinated tap water. The choice for breakfast was very limited. Two slices of bread with butter and jam was the top choice. Check-out time is 11am.
