Great place to escape the hustle and just relax.,"We stay here every year so I know that its basic village bali style so not “hotel Aussie cleaning style” if you can understand that you will love it. I accidentally booked “room with fan” which meant it had no aircon and they put us in their “new” dungeon rooms on the lower level not the bungalow rooms that we have stayed in every other year. I assumed it would have fan plus aircon but that wasn’t the case, so just make sure you book the correct room that you are after. The “rooms with fan” are clean but even more basic with no bar fridge and no windows on the sides just the front sliding door so be aware if you get hot that you’ll have to put the fan near your face ha! Would still visit again though as we love Balian.","title: We love the slow Balian old school Bali vibes and would stay att Gubug again like we do every year. liked: We love Gubug for the yummy food and real old school Bali vibes plus the husband loves the Balian waves for surfing.
