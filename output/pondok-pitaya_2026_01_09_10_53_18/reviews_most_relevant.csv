Melita,Australia,Two-Bedroom Villa (6 Adults),6 nights,Couple,09-10-2025 00:00:00,Beautiful location. Right on Balian Beach. Peaceful and charming.,9.0,en,"Beautiful location. Quite out of the way tho. 3 to 4 hours from Denpasar airport. Came here because my husband surfs and kite surfs. I don't think you'd come here as a destination unless you're a surfer. The sand is black and rocky. I didn't swim at the beach, just the pool. There are no shops or cafes anywhere close. You'd need transport to take you into the nearest town, but that didn't worry us as we weren't after that kind of trip, and were very happy to stay put in the hotel the whole time, just relaxing and unwinding from our busy lives. We both practise Yoga and there are 2 lovely Yoga shalas. One overlooking the beach, the other nestled in the garden area around the back. We stayed in one of the house/bungalows. We had A/C, a fridge and a kettle. Some rooms do not have this so if that's important to you make sure your room has this. Those 3 are deal breakers for us. There are also a whole set of basic rooms, and a few other types of rooms which some travellers may be totally fine with. Just depends on what you're after. Look into it before you book so you know what to expect from your room. The staff are friendly and such warm people. The food at the restaurant is great. Generous breakfast was included. If you order food at the restaurant, it takes a while to come out but that didn't bother us at all, being on a holiday and not in a rush. Gave us time to sit, read, talk and chill. Other guests are friendly, nice people, rather than the posey, loud, drunk vibe you might get at busier resorts down south. The rooms are made up and cleaned beautifully. We had 2 bathrooms. One of the toilets leaked and was a bit smelly which will need to be fixed. Daily yoga is fantastic, the teacher was brilliant and a beautiful friendly person. We will come back, hopefully next year.",One of the toilets leaked and was a bit smelly which will need to be fixed.,"title: Beautiful location. Right on Balian Beach.

This is exactly what brought me here back in 2018, and it’s the reason I keep coming back. disliked: One thing that could be improved is the music in the café. It would be great to hear something more traditional or calm and chill, rather than loud pop tracks that don’t quite match the vibe of the place. The only other downside is the price, which feels about 20% higher than expected, especially with cheaper options nearby. Still, I return every time because this place has become a meaningful part of my Bali experience.",0,0,

When I asked at the kitchen, they said that they could lend us some cups, ,but nothing else. I think for the price this is not satisfactory. The restaurant food was a bit expensive. The breakfast sounded good but wasn't. We both had the Super breakfast which was strange, instead of toast it was served with 2 very oily hash browns.

Ansonsten war es die unangenehmste und ungepflegteste Unterkunft, die wir während unseres fünfwöchigen Baliaufenthaltes hatten.","Bei Ankunft haben wir eine dreckige Wohnung vorgefunden. Der Boden war nicht sauber, voller Krümel, Sand, Tierkot. Die Handtücher haben gestunken und waren fleckig. Die gesamte Unterkunft war stickig und modrig. wir haben gebeten, die Unterkunft noch mal zu reinigen. Anschließend war der Boden leider immer noch völlig dreckig. so dass wir erneut das Servicepersonal bemühen mussten. Sehr unangenehm für alle. Die Armaturen im Bad waren unbeschreiblich rostig, alt ä, schmutzig. Aus dem Wasserhahn ist braune Brühe heraus gelaufen. Der Wasserkocher war total verkalkt. Auch dies mussten wir leider ansprechen, der Wasserkocher wurde freundlicherweise ausgetauscht und auch die Armaturen wurden überraschenderweise gewechselt. Allerdings waren diese nicht kompatibel, so dass sie ständig abgefallen sind und wir eine Fontäne im Bad hatten. Es gibt leider keine Moskitonetze in dieser Unterkunft, was notwendig wäre. Die Klimaanlage ist mehrfach ausgefallen und wurde durch das Personal immer wieder repariert. Nachts haben wir natürlich niemanden hierfür bemüht, was dann zu sehr stickigen Verhältnissen geführt hat. Der Pool ist alt, es fehlen viele Kacheln oder sind zum Teil abgebrochen, aber keiner kümmert sich darum, diese zu reparieren. Die Unterkunft ist zwar nahezu direkt am Strand, es gibt aber keinen Weg, sondern man steigt über einigen Müll und zum Strand zu gelangen. Dies könnte man auch etwas netter gestalten mit einem kleinen Weg. Beim Frühstück kann man aus drei Optionen wählen (lediglich eine vegetarische Option, eine indonesische Option). Das Frühstück wird völlig lieblos zubereitet, das Omelette enthält keinerlei Gemüse oder zumindest etwas grüne Kräuter oder sonstige Dekoration. Es gibt lediglich eine Scheibe weißen Toast dazu. Man kann Obst mit Joghurt und Granola wählen.
