The hotel location is great- right in front of the wave and a few restaurants  around. The rooms were clean and a generous size. Pool nice and clean.

"Quiet retreat next to the beach. Absolutely loved this place, a great place to go to just relax, unwind, and watch the surf.

Check-in was without issue and the staff were accommodating. 

Room was basic and rustic, but was still fantastic. I was lucky enough to have a room that had a view of the beach, and an open air shower.

Restaurant was decent, but unfortunately the restaurant across the road was closed for renovations. Top tip, bring some cash so you can visit the other restaurants behind the resort.

Beach was special.

"A group of friends & I just organized a dinner here at Pondok Pitaya last night and it was amazing.

The guy who helped orchestrate the dinner was named Darius and he was an amazing help, very giving of his time to answer any questions I had about planning the dinner.

We as a group ordered the Babi Guling, and it was amazing. The staff was super friendly and set up a reserved table area near the front of the restaurant so we can have our own space + watch the sunset, as they brought out the Suckling Pig & cut it open right in front of us, as well as created a separate table of everything we need to create the Babi Guling, with rice, veggies, sambal, etc.

The food was amazing & the service was awesome - one of my friends literally thanked me for inviting her for what she called a ""celebrity dinner"", because the staff made it feel very special and we felt very cared for.

It was an amazing night that we will all remember thanks to the great people and great food here.

Pondok Pitaya in itself is THE place, it's very quiet and relaxing at night, you can hear the sound of the ocean, the insects and frogs, and it never gets too hot at night, it's just the perfect environment for a proper rest. 
It's also the perfect place for Yoga: they have 2 yoga shalas and the teachers are really good, you can join every day in the morning or in the evening.

"I was going to review this place last night and give it full marks, but then I checked out and got ripped off. 

At checkout I knew I had to fix up the bill for four beers and a bowl of tempeh chips, and was presented with a bill of 770000 instead of what should have been about 300000. Realistically, it's only about $50 Aus difference which won't kill me, but that's not the point.

Their argument is that the night before I didn't have enough money, so asked to go back to my room to get money. I did that, then went back to pay the bill - even got one last beer and paid for that too (the receipts even showed the different time stamps). However they asked me to pay for it again at checkout and refused to listen that I had already paid. 

Maybe they just weren't happy that I ate all of my meals while I was staying there at the several different local warungs that offered a larger selection at much better prices.

The food was good and the service staff all super helpful with amazing English. This was really helpful for me as a coeliac as I was easily able to order and ask for no soy sauce/ kecap manis/ chicken stock powder with no issues, which is not usually the case in Bali!

For coeliacs travelling to Balian- it was easier to eat here than I expected despite no reviews for gluten free food anywhere in Balian which nearly stopped us coming. So glad we came!

I brought my own gf soy sauce and kecap manis to Pondok Pitaya and ordered Nasi goreng and also pork sambal Mayah without any soy/kecap manis, then just added my own. Also had poached eggs with homemade potato roesti, bacon and spinach which was delicious. Be aware they do fry other breaded and battered foods in the fryer though, I'm asymptomatic so I decided to chance it. They also have smoothie bowls which look yum.

"We have travelled to Bali many times and we stay at places like the Intercontinental and Club Med but we were missing the sole and real Bali, plus I wanted somewhere to surf.

Part of me doesn't want to write this review as I don't want everyone to know about this place so it doesn't get over crowded but on the other side I want people to know the old real Bali still exists

This place is perfect for what we wanted. The surf break was right in front of the hotel and is full of really down to earth surfers who are there to chill and relax. There are normally enough peaks for everyone and for different levels. The beach is great for kids to play although the surf can be a bit rough so worth going up the beach and there is soccer game with the local kids every day. 

The hotel is great with the basics but if you are looking for 5 star then maybe look somewhere else as there are other places. To me the price was really fair and the breakfast which was included was fantastic after an early morning surf.

The massages on the beach are great for both surfers, adults and kids and I tried to have one every day which didnt break the bank

They have yoga there but my wife would go to some of the places outside the hotel as there are lots and she was looking for something specifically to suit her. 

There are also lots fo cafes (refer other reviews) which i would highly recommend although the restaurant at the hotel was great.

"I spent almost one month in this beautiful place, attending a yoga full immersion course between August and September. This experience has been so intense and important for me that it just made me love completely this place too. The rooms are simple and typical Balinese style, there are different options of accommodation and it  can be perfect for small groups as they have houses too. The food is delicious and the staff was absolutely wonderful. In front of the hotel there's a stunning beach, quite big and never ever crowded.

"So happy we decided to visit Balian Beach and stay at Pondok Pitaya!  Fair warning that it is a trek from the airport - traffic meant that we had a 3 hour drive - but so worth it once you are there.  

The hotel staff coordinated our transport for us, and kept the kitchen open so that we could eat when we arrived after our long drive.  Breakfast was great, although it would be amazing if it could start at 7 am.  The food was fantastic - my husband and I are still talking about the pork belly bowl.  And, my 6 y/o daughter loved the popsicles (natural, local fresh fruit, small size) - I think she ate 3 per day.

Our room was clean with good amenities and very quiet.  The pool was great - cleaned every morning and a great view of the beach.  

We did the waterfall hike one day, which we really enjoyed.  There weren't any of the typical tourist spots that we were forced to go to - just a 1 hour drive past beautiful scenery (lots of real rice fields and wild jungle), a nice hike to the waterfall, as much time to swim as we wanted, and then lunch at a fantastic warung that was locals-only.  We could decide when we wanted to head back to the hotel and made it back for an afternoon in the ocean.

This spot is about the beach!  There isn't a lot nearby.  We did walk around the small village - we did sunset drinks as a nearby restaurant and visited the local temple.  The rest of the area is just local families.

For anyone that is looking for a real Bali experience, I would recommend Balian Beach and Pondok Pitaya.","{""stay_date"": ""2018-03-31"", ""trip_type"": ""family""}",Great location and food,[],4,en,"{""name"": ""jenhart1"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Portland"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 40827, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Portland, Maine""}, ""username"": ""jenhart1"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""78D12ACAC6A8EE4F57030D91D17539A2"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenhart1"", ""contribution_count"": 5}",571277226,0,,"[{""name"": ""value"", ""label"": ""Value"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 4}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r571277226-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Hi Jenhart,\n\nThank you so much for your kind words.

"Yoga & surf? Pondok Pitaya is the best place in Balian.

The place is clean & the food is also good! Try the yellow & red chicken curry!

Go for 10 minutes walk and you can find beautiful spot for sunset just beside Pondok Pitaya. You can go tracking to the waterfall (forgot the name), just ask the receptionist to guide you.

You can also see bat cave near Pondok Pitaya, please see the pic as attached.

"The rooms, food, grounds, yoga shala, surfing, pool, black sand beach, wonderful staff, weather, surrounding cafes, shops, and nearby beaches... it was all totally incredible. All of it. Couldn't have been better, and it was more than any of us (group of 11) had expected. 

Notes: our particular rooms were clean, had working a/c, comfortable queen beds, netting, ample towels, tea and an electric kettle, great natural and other light + decor, partial outdoor bathrooms (read: the occasional bug), and hot water. Bottles of water were provided daily. BE SURE to use it to brush your teeth. Don't drink from the faucet. 

Other notes: Towels were provided at the pool as well. The menu had lots of veggie options, and the drinks, coconuts, fresh juices at the restaurant were TDF. Also, everything was served/prepared/washed with filtered water. 

The staff was amaze-balls. We had one woman who was sick the first night, so the manager asked a driver to stay overnight, ready to escort her to the hospital, just in case. Seriously, above and beyond. 

The black sand beaches were dramatic, clean and beautiful, and the surfing was awesome. Pipes to the right and left--at the edge of a river delta, so typically good surfing. Clean bottoms where we were (tumbling rocks but no coral). 

The pool was great. Nice temp. Tons of places to sit and sun. Clean and refreshing. 

Yoga shala: clean, gorgeous view, quiet and peaceful, with stereo surround sound for our music compilations. Mats and blocks were provided, too, which was nice for those of us who either forgot or didn't bring mats. Classes offered on-site 2x/day. 

In all, I couldn't have asked for more or for a better experience. Highly recommend (in case you couldn't tell).

"This was a last minute booking and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel is located right next to Balian beach, with a restaurant, pool, beautifully kept gardens and lots of space. It is in a fairly remote location with only a handful of other places to eat and a cafe, however I found the food to be tasty and well-presented  and very reasonably priced. My room (a River Suite room) was clean and small but adequate, with an ensuite shower room and small terrace outside, with a wooden table and chairs. There is air conditioning but you can request a fan if you prefer. I attended two yoga classes, and the teacher (Nicky I think) was excellent. The yoga shala was a lovely building in the gardens, looking out to the ocean.  I also had a massage in a palappa next to the beach and really enjoyed listening to the waves crashing in. There were lots of surfers enjoying this beautiful part of western Bali and the black sandy beach was clean and easy to walk along. The drive across from Ubud was really pretty (except for the towns) with jungle, ravines and rice terraces. I had my own driver but they can arrange transport if necessary.

After arriving from staying at a 5 star plus resort in Ubud our first thoughts were wondering if we'd done the right thing. That though was soon squashed once we entered or river suite. Loved the view of the surf from the shower. With not much to do there I went and hired a surfboard for the 3 days and hit the surf while Deidre went to yoga with Nikki. She was instantly addicted and never missed a class (4) with him. I tried to surf with not much luck. The surfing out there is definitely suited to a medium to experienced surfer. I decided next time I will be bringing a boogie board. We really enjoyed our short stay on the yoga couples retreat. A massage each by the sea was very relaxing. Food wasn't the best we had tasted but for the price it was good value. Probably the first time we had relaxed in a long time. We will definitely be returning on our next trip. ,"{""stay_date"": ""2017-05-31"", ""trip_type"": ""couples""}",We'll be back,"[""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/a9/photo0jpg.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/aa/photo1jpg.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/ab/photo2jpg.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/ac/photo3jpg.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/ad/photo4jpg.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/ae/photo5jpg.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/af/photo6jpg.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/b0/photo7jpg.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/41/70/b1/photo8jpg.jpg""]",5,en,"{""name"": ""Steve B"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/63/29/9b/caption.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Cairns Region"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 1151199, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Cairns Region, Australia""}, ""username"": ""stevebE729XC"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""F3AA205185B6039CFA2AA532511DA2F0"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebE729XC"", ""contribution_count"": 162}",483772303,0,,[],https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r483772303-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Hi Steve,\n\nthank you for your kind testimonial.

I wish to express my sincere appreciation to Darius (General Manager) who is doing an outstanding job in overseeing the day to day operations of this lovely hotel. I am in the hospitality industry and therefor appreciate the fine work that the staff and management dedicate to their guests.

"We enjoyed staying at this hotel for the 4 nights we were in Balian. The location is amazing, right in front of the surf break. You could even see the waves from our room which was a plus so we could see if the surf was good. Be sure to get a room with AC, it's super hot here during the day! 

The restaurant menu had lots of variety. The food is good. We ate here for every meal. 

Yoga classes are available twice a day, morning and evening. The yoga is legit, but be prepared to sweat! 

Having the pool close to the beach was nice, though you can't see the ocean when you're in it - would've been a perfect spot for an infinity pool! The cushions for the pool lounge chairs are due for a change as well as the pool towels (most likely stained from the dark sand). 

One thing that really stood out was the use of moth balls everywhere. The rooms and the public washrooms smelled strongly of them. For those with an aversion to the scent, beware.

"I spent 2 nights in Pondok Pitaya. I don't quite sure what to expect from a surfer hotel since i don't surf. But, it's actually very great experience for me. I stayed in the back building. Luckily they gave me the first floor room. So, every morning i can stare at the beautiful view of the garden while sipping my Hot Teh Tarik in the balcony and I could still catch a glimpse of sunrise. The room was okay. Mine's equipped with Air Con. I dont think it's needed since Balian is a bit cold at night for me. No telephone in the room so you really need to get out of the room to order something at the restaurant or (i guess) you can use your local number to call the room service.
The hotel's just one step away from the beach. You can see people surf the wave from the restaurant. The food is great. If only they have Grilled Squid on the menu. 
The beach's is stunning. It almost feels like a private beach coz it's the only hotel who have direct access. You can jog or have a stroll while waiting for the sunset there.
Over all its an amazing location for a relaxing stay. Great place, friendly staff, great food (my tummy's happy!). I couldn't ask for more.

"We stayed at the Pondok Pitaya for 5 nights. The hotel has a Balinese feel and is located right on the beach at the end of a road that runs through the local village. A local river also runs into the sea adjacent to the hotel. Balian is very quiet and being a rural area, has no 'nightlife' or shops.  If you're not into surfing or yoga, bring a good book ........ or perhaps several - and it can be a very relaxing holiday.
Balian is approximately 2 hours up the west coast from Legian. It is primarily a surfing spot and this hotel has tended to cater for that market through comfortable but basic rooms for surfers. However it appears to be attempting to expand its appeal and now also has more comfortable accommodation behind the basic beachfront units. We stayed in this newer accommodation (known as the 'River Suites'). There are Ground and First Floor Levels - and they've been constructed of timber recycled from old fishing boats. It's a clever bit of eco-friendly building work and looks great. Ensuites come with each room and these are open air with privacy walls. Our room was large and airy with good ventilation and A/C if required. No fridge or kettle is provided.
Yoga is held in the morning and afternoon at the hotel. The classes are conducted in a pavilion in the middle of the well maintained gardens adjacent to the beach. 
The hotel has a cafe and bar area and the food is quite good and not expensive. Breakfast was included in our tariff and we had a set choice of a 'Healthy', 'Local' or 'Western' breakfast. We had the 'Healthy' each morning and it was fresh and enjoyable.  The hotel also has an attractive pool area and sun lounges adjacent to the beach.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Across the road from the hotel and overlooking the beach is the cafe, 'Sushi Surf'. Good sushi; not expensive and a great view of the surf. 
Just up the hill about 50 metres from 'Sushi Surf' is the more traditional 'Deki's Warung'. Good local food at very reasonable prices in a friendly casual atmosphere - and again, with a great view of the surf.
The costs were reasonable and I'm happy to recommend this hotel if you're going to Balian.","{""stay_date"": ""2016-06-30"", ""trip_type"": ""couples""}",Stunning surfing location and relaxing stay,[],4,en,"{""name"": ""David M"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/77/0f/4e/david-m.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Bellingen"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 488319, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Bellingen, Australia""}, ""username"": ""davidmU8011WO"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""858D7C540A65666FDCE1743A16F31006"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmU8011WO"", ""contribution_count"": 48}",392289493,2,Upstairs rooms in the River Suites get a better breeze from the sea and more natural light.,"[{""name"": ""value"", ""label"": ""Value"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 4}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r392289493-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Hi David,\n\nThank you for your kind testimonial.

"We have just spent 6 days at Pondok Pitaya with our three surf crazy children (16, 16 & 12) & after reading mixed reviews & being used to 5 star accommodation I wasn't quite sure what to expect!! 

We absolutely loved it!!

We stayed in the huge Happy House & were extremely happy!! With no aircon (which I hate anyway) & only fans & mosquito nets I was curious how we would go on the first night! I sprayed all our beds inside the nets before we went to sleep every night & we didn't have one mosquito!! It was so lovely & cool that I had to turn our bedroom fan off during the night - perfect!

Our large fridge meant we could stock up on water & drinks for the family & with 2 large bathrooms (very rustic but all part of the charm) there was plenty of room for all of us. Or house had 6 beds & could sleep 10 people.

We loved the fact that we could spend the day lying on the lilo, swimming & watching the boys surf. Pondok Pitaya is right on the beach & smack bang in front of the surf break - best position in Balian.

We found the staff very friendly, lovely massages & thought the food was well priced & delicious. We loved the 3 choices for breakfast as honestly how much food can you eat from a buffet breakfast without it all going to waste?? The 3 choices were perfect - Healthy (fruit salad with granola & yoghurt & eggs any style & toast), Indonesian (huge Mie or Nasi Goreng) or Western (full cooked breakfast).  All came with fresh juice and tea or coffee. Once again perfect!!!

All up we loved our 6 day stay & will definitely be back next year ","{""stay_date"": ""2016-07-31"", ""trip_type"": ""family""}",Surfing Paradise,"[""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/ec/27/58/breakfast.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/ec/27/59/breakfast.jpg""]",4,en,"{""name"": ""LovingLife"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/eb/1c/0b/caption.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Perth"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 255103, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Perth, Australia""}, ""username"": ""tamaraline3"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""745C67B67A174D530141B0EB37D515CC"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamaraline3"", ""contribution_count"": 225}",390547919,0,,[],https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r390547919-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Hi Tamara,\n\nThank you for your kind testimonial, we are very happy to hear that you had a great time here with us.

"Firstly let me say this is the second year in a row I have spent a week here with my family (wife and kids aged 3,7,9). I would return to Balian and stay here again, but ONLY for the location. The hotel and service could be significantly improved, especially given the price you pay.

For Balian, the accommodation is massively overpriced, you can easily stay almost anywhere else for 20-60% of what you pay at Pondok Pitaya and as far as I can tell, you're paying just for the location. 

The buildings (aside from the ugly river suite out the back) are quaint Javanese inspired, but are dark inside with little airflow and they feel dirty. The bathrooms are very rudimentary with industrial valves for taps, no plugs for the basin etc. 

I noticed that since last year they have installed much better mosquito nets over all the beds, perhaps due to the increased incidence of dengue fever in the area. 

The place is overrun with dogs. Personally I love dogs and the ones here are lovely, healthy and friendly so it's a plus for me, but if you don't like dogs, be warned.

The surf break averages 1 shark attack per year so that helps keep the crowds down :). Don't swim or surf after rain as the rivermouth empties lots of disgusting detritus into the ocean and you're likely to end up with hep-a, an ear infection or something worse.

GOOD
The location is amazing. The complex is literally on the beach with the restaurant and pool being just steps from the sand. While not great for swimming or lying around, the black sand beach has a certain beauty to it. The wave is super fun but can get reasonably heavy when it's bigger. The included breakfast is pretty good. The 'Healthy' option has a fruit bowl with yoghurt and a sprinkling of granola with eggs any style  a green juice has been my regular.   Its a great place for kids, very safe, very open and our kids just ganged up with other kids also on holiday and roamed around in tribes from room to pool. If you can tolerate the heat, walks up and down the beach are great, sunsets from the headland by secret cove are also worth the walk. Watch the cloud of bats escape the cave at ~620-630 pm every night. Most of the rooms have a large covered balcony area you can sit on lounge style furniture and watch the surf. This is the main attraction of this place.

There is a large yoga studio which you can use when the classes are not on. I travel with my own matt and prefer my own schedule so didn't attend a class (quite expensive at 125,000Rps), but the space is very nice.

BAD
Wifi is awful. It's almost like they have only one access point for the entire resort. In order to access it you have to be sitting in the restaurant and even then it only seems to be reliable when you sit right by the reception side of the restaurant. Forget about getting wifi in your room. As well as being unreliable, it's also very slow. The staff seem to know this, but the don't really care.

They provide 4x 250ml water bottles per day and charge for refills. I personally travel with my own water bottles and try not to put more plastic into the ocean, but once again, they don't seem to care here. Yes I know that it's standard in Bali to pay for bottled water, but at the price you pay to stay here, they should have a 19l water dispenser bottle in each room.  A 19l water tank costs 15,000Rps at the local store. Filling a 1l bottle at Pondok Pitaya costs 10,000Rps. Just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I went and bought my own dispenser and put it in my room for 75,000Rps.

Aside from the included breakfast, don't bother with the restaurant. There is no soul, care or love in the food and once again, it's more expensive than anywhere else in Balian. Eat anywhere else. My pick is Deckies Warung a 2min stroll up the hill. Great view, great vibe, great food. Oh and it's 1/2 the price.

The pool could be incredible but instead it's poorly maintained, either overclorinated so it burns your eyes and turns your hair green, or under chlorinated so it gets filthy and slimy. Because the resort is so open, despite they signs saying 'pool only for guests' there are frequently many users of the pool who are not staying here.

They seem to run out of pool towels at about 11am, so don't expect to get one if you're late. Again the staff don't seem to care...'maybe you try this afternoon'.

The beds are awful. If you're a hot sleeper like me, it's bad enough not having air conditioning and minimal airflow, but compounded with a cheap foam mattress it makes for some very hot sleeps. Again for what you are paying here, you should expect a decent mattress. 

It's not all bad. The staff are polite and friendly. Some of them do make an effort, but many are just going through the motions. Despite all the above, we have had a great week here for a second time and if there weren't so many other places to explore, we would come back for a third year :)","{""stay_date"": ""2016-07-31"", ""trip_type"": ""family""}",Amazing location - huge room for improvement.,[],2,en,"{""name"": ""JoeTravelerNZ"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Hamilton"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 255108, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Hamilton, New Zealand""}, ""username"": ""JoeTravelerNZ"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""3B2C4446781235F4716ED809F01A79EE"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeTravelerNZ"", ""contribution_count"": 28}",389236429,0,Don&#39;t stay in the river suite unless you require aircon.,"[{""name"": ""rooms"", ""label"": ""Rooms"", ""rating"": 2}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 3}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 3}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r389236429-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Kia ora Joe,\n\nThank you for your feed back and thank you for spending time here with us. \n\nfirst of all, for the water.. you forgot to tell the crowd how you intimidate the staff on giving a bad review on trip advisor because you dont get a 19L gallon automatically after a long stroll into the village in the middle of the day.

Our average stay here is one day to three days, if we provide such large amount of water to the guest..we would have so much waste (stale water and contaminated water). I am more concern about wasting good quality of water (you can check on the net how valuable good water here in Bali due to long dry season) than plastic waste. We recycle all of our plastic waste properly. We provide water accordingly and we top it up daily. Perhaps next time, you can request for a large gallon, we will be more than glad to provide you one.\n\nOur restaurant provide the best quality for the price we offer, Balian have a wide price range for its restaurant.

They called our next accommodation to assist in booking. The included breakfast is delicious and has a wide range for choice.

"I wanted to do a three day yoga retreat while visiting Bali. Due to late booking etc. the only place I found was this. Firstly, don't book any package, you can book anything as you want on site cheaper. 
The feeling is more of a surf camp than yoga retreat and would classify it as two star rather than the official four star. 
It is right on the beach, but the beach is Dirty so would not plan to spend any significant time there. 
When I arrived the hot water in my room was not working; and they couldn't fix it till next day. 
For the massage I was offered a mattress on the floor, no towls in sight etc. It didn't feel like a clean or relaxing environment so in the end i kindly declined. 
The hotel restaurant was well below average, this also included the breakfast served. 
The hotel is very secluded; there are a couple of other restaurants nearby - but they only take cash so make sure you bring some.

We had a room in front of the kitchen area, to the side of the check in area.

Also, there was a hole cut into the bamboo wall right next to the bed, the wall was again connecting out to the staff area. Needless to say we reported the issue right away, and we happened to report it when the owner himself was there as well.. However nothing as done about it! The peeping-Tom issue was swept under the carpet, so the other customers were not alarmed. No compensation was offered, we were then treated differently after that...the curtains were not even repaired or changed! Needless to say we left.

The girls stayed in your room, and the boys are next door. I assume somehow the boys made the ciggy hole for their own naughty purpose (and vandalizing our property). \n\nLooking at the layout on the outside, it is hard task to peep (not that we tried or encourage it) because it is exactly where we put the 12kg gas canister for the hot water along with its canopy and there are a lot of staff traffic so you cant stay there without someone else noticing. Our back end staffs, are mainly older lady, if they ever found toms peep lurking in their area of work..i think the punishment will be more severe than a big yell or a scold.\n\nI would launched the same complaint too if i was in your position. Please rest assure that we take our health and safety and quality of service very seriously, especially towards privacy issue. We have changed the burnt curtain to make sure we can give our future guest a peace of mind while staying with us. Again, thank you for putting this issue forward and on behalf of the hotel we apologize for the inconvenience caused. \n\n- Pondok Pitaya -"", ""language"": ""en"", ""response_id"": 376613384, ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DSadeli"", ""published_date"": ""2016-05-26"", ""avatar_image_link"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg"", ""connection_to_place"": ""General Manager""}",2016-05-22,en,2016-05-25,,,,
"Stayed here out of main season and it was pretty quiet, despite the fact that it is literaly right on the beach.  The surf was epic, lefts and rights up to about 8ft.  Didn't really hold any bigger so headed off to Medewi.  Watch the river after rain, can create some nasty rips and bring diown some rubbish.
Pondok is an older style Bali accom, most room dont have aircon, but then ones that do are at the back of the complex in a well landscaped area but with no views.  The beach is not safe to swim, but the pool is great and there is a big grassed area for whatever.  I surfed alot, my wife did yoga alot ,but there is not much else do do or see whithout a tour, a motorbike or rental.  And watch the main road, its chaos, but we were gutted we had to leave.  Food at the Pondok is very good and at a reasonable price for the area, but several options close by so no worries.  Great little vibe, no hassles from trinket or t shirt sellers no surf mafia like at Medewi (very few locals in the surf) and a cleanish sandy beach.  If you like a bit of a getaway spot to chill and surf, then this is it, we will be back for sure.

"We stayed for 4 nights in a river suite. Block A has very firm beds, so we moved to block C, for softer beds, which was no problem. Great location, pool, gardens and buildings, Balinese feeling for sure. Staff friendly. Food great and good sizes. Plenty of other food options also close by. Air con in the river suites was great, although it's a small room, we still fitted 4 boards and luggage in as well. Right in front of the surf it's a top spot. We had some perfect 4ft clean surfs in the morning and afternoons. Can get windy midday which affects quality. 2 weeks before the last shark attack, people also saw a shark fin that followed them in one morning , that sort of spooked us a bit. Then it rained and the water got real dirty, so surfing not recommended, but it didn't seem to stop anyone, we also went out but it's in your mind. When it got big, we surfed medewi lefts, which was about 5-6ft, and super fun, not too heavy, and longer rides.

"If you're staying near Balian Beach, this is pretty much your only option for yoga, and it's accessible even if you're not staying at the hotel. Nicky's morning yoga class was of medium intensity good for beginners and intermediate yogis (even those who aren't staying at the Pondok Pitaya villas). He offered lots of options for both an easier and harder practice, and took time at the end of class to teach a sitting vinyasa - using your upper body to go from standing to sitting. I learned a lot from this section and appreciated him taking so much time and care to walk through all the steps with the class.  Plus, it's timing of 10:30 - 12pm is the perfect time to work up a sweat for lunch, which you can grab right next door. It's mediocre, but reasonably priced.

The afternoon class was, frankly, painful. It was 90 minutes of slow stretching with almost no movement. Even though I was sore from surfing, I was bored within the first 30 minutes and struggled to stay focused for the next 60.","{""stay_date"": ""2016-05-31"", ""trip_type"": ""solo""}","For yoga, come for the morning, skip the afternoon class",[],3,en,"{""name"": ""krametime"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/ee/c2/0d/anne-k.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Portland"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 52024, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Portland, Oregon""}, ""username"": ""krametime"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""E9024D09ED5078A78FE5952B0C8A86B8"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krametime"", ""contribution_count"": 55}",372584091,0,,"[{""name"": ""location"", ""label"": ""Location"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 4}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r372584091-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Dear Krametime,\n\nGlad to know that you are having a great yoga time here in Pondok Pitaya.

"Don't do it 
I have stayed at balian on many occasions and this was the second time in the happy house. Balian is a beautiful place thought pondok pitaya leaves a bad taste in your mouth. We stayed on the happy house for five nights and paid top dollar for it. To insult you for doing so the included breakfast is a joke, they have a 'special' menu for guest, non guests can select from a menu that has reasonable selection though we were informed we could not have this ( remembering I just paid approx $1400 Aus for five nights
The staff here were extremely rude, uninterested and lazy, a complete opposite of all other Balinese I have had the pleasure of making great friendships with over the last decade
The whole time we were there the pool was unable to be used due to the extremely high chlorine content, not a little bit, it was literally burning the kids and my skin instantly. We had no choice to then pay 190 k daily to use pool at Gajah Mina ( up the road) so kids could swim.
The happy house is rustic and that is its charm, though this stay was exceptional, we had cats jumping into bathroom and entering our room through the night. This could be easily overcome, though as previously stated, staff could not give a ....

"We dropped into the Pondok Pitaya Hotel for the day as we drove up from Canggu where we were staying to check out the surf. 

Location - at Bailan Beach north west in  Bali, approx 1.5hrs drives drive north of Seminyak.  The hotel is located on the beachfront so its perfect for watching the sunset & the waves. 

The hotel is  suited to surfers or those looking for a yoga retreat. 

The beach is lovely but its not really suited to swimmers due to the rocky formation in the shallow waters. 

There is a swimming pool overlooking the ocean. The pool is on the small size but its adequate a little need of attention & renovation is needed. However ; we enjoyed using it to cool off from the hot December sun. 

Yoga was held in a lovely thatched roof building located in the heart of the hotel gardens overlooking the beach. It did look very peaceful. 

The rooms looked extremely cute with recycled timber facade & timber interior. The large separate houses also looked seriously suited to large groups , young surfers or those just looking for space. 

The open outdoor restaurant was excellent & the food tasty & cheap. There are a few other small cafes up the road too. 

Overall - undeveloped region of Bali , if looking for serenity in a beach location with simple tastes & budget then Pondok Pitaya Hotel is ideal for a beach yoga retreat.","{""stay_date"": ""2016-01-31"", ""trip_type"": ""couples""}",Beach retreat !,"[""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/af/ec/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b0/19/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b0/2f/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b0/49/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b0/65/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b0/7c/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b0/9f/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b0/dc/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b1/0e/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b1/4b/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b1/64/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b1/83/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b1/9f/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b1/cc/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b1/e6/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b1/fd/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b2/22/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b2/38/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b2/56/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/31/b2/66/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg""]",5,en,"{""name"": ""Ellemay "", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c2/f5/d6/ellemay.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Sydney"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 255060, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Sydney, Australia""}, ""username"": ""Ellemay"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""32B6F6FB9B23AA24BB42084899E56645"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellemay"", ""contribution_count"": 47123}",340789428,1,,[],https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r340789428-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Hi Ellemay,\n\nThank you for your kind and detailed testimonial...We are happy to hear that you had more fun here in Balian Beach rather than Canggu.

Because the room concept is for relaxation only, so they don't provide wifi and TV in the room. Wifi only available in restaurant area, so people can really have a good rest in the room. 

The location is perfect, because you can see Balian Beach from the restaurant & pool. The food is good too, they have vegetarian and non-vegetarian menu.

This place is perfect if you want a peaceful holiday, because the location of the hotel is far from the city (about 2 hours from Denpasar).

"This place is so amazing, I didn't realize there is a sort of ""hidden paradise"" in Bali. It suits me, as I wanted to take a break from my hectic life for a while. This place was making a perfect gateway for me. A best place to do Yoga, and the ocean wave is very good for someone who wants to do surfing.
This place is Nearby the clean river that connected to the ocean, and also there is a waterfall, too bad it was dry season, so the waterfall was not as beautiful as usual
The room was clean and unique. The garden was very beautiful. The staffs were nice and friendly.
Last but not least, the foods are very good. I tried Yellow Curry Chicken, Red Curry Chicken, Fish and Chips (I can taste that they use premium Dori fish), even the ordinary fried rice was very tasty. My toddler (1,5 years) could finish the fried rice all by her self, as she usually not easily to be fed.

"I booked the happy house....a big mistake the house was dirty (geko / frog poo every where) it was dark and very open letting heaps of mozzies in. Mosquitoe nets had holes and both my 2 and 4 year old were eaten alive despite mozzie nets down and mozzie coil burning all night we also taped up holes for my peice of mind. Frogs were always getting in the house....it didn't bother me to much. After 2 nights of mozzie hell i complained as i was sure my kids were going to get sick. They moved us out to the river suite rooms- two rooms with connecting doors. This room although not ocean view (what i paid for with happy house) was alot better seemed fairly new had awsome mozzie nets that worked, really cool waterfalls and ponds full of fish that kept the kids amused. Breakfast was ok not alot of options but the fresh juice was always nice to start the day with. Service on the other had is touch and go -some mornings my or my partners meals were forgoten. Other meals from here were nice, but alot cheaper up the hill or on the beach all of them were nice.
Wifi was a joke......we ended up going up the hill to istana that had super fast wifi so we could upload pics.
Pool was cloudy most days and had a green sludge on it one morning but thankfully my kids did not get sick....be warned there are many dogs that visit and roam the hotel grounds and also use the pool. The dogs also like to stalk you while u eat your food!!! The staff do squirt water on them to get rid of them.
Pool sun lounges were old and worn with holes,  mould ect and there was not enough for resort guest. If u didn't get in early the day trippers took them over.
I found reception staff very helpful and they were very helpful when i needed to change rooms due to mozzie problems one staff member even game me some mozzie bite cream for my son- that was nice. Staff very friendly.
This place has the best location the grounds were immaculate beautiful gardens, very peaceful. Its a shame that the beachfront rooms are dated and to open.

"Pondok Pitaya
I have just finished 45 days in Balian and loved every minute of it. Everyday the surf is almost perfect if not perfect and the smiles and vibes throughout the village makes you feel way more welcome than at home. When you step onto the property of Pondok Pitaya you are first stunned in awe with how perfectly situated you are in front of great waves with the most immaculate landscaping and ocean front pool. The staff at Pondok Pitaya go over and above what they can do to accommodate you and makes everyone feel extremely relaxed. There landscapers are absolutely incredible. Any and all meals that I have had were excellent and my last go to meal was the Chicken Schnitzel sandwhich was incredible and you never have to worry about a shortage of drinks at there beautiful bar which can accommodate from a simple beer to some fancy western cocktail umbrella style drinks... they have you covered. If anybody out there needs a solid family friendly resort this is it! Nothing but solid words of recommendation to anyone out there looking into booking here for your next Bali experience. The smiles, the giggles, the great waves...Im already missing this place.

"I stayed here for one month for an organized event and was impressed with the beautiful location and setting, however extremely disappointed with the state and price of my shared room and the daily buffet. 
The room itself was made of concrete cylinders and the bathroom was always wet and dark. There was no hot water and at one point the shower pipe burst and the remedy was to smother it with more concrete - which didn't work and made for a leaky, squirty wall. It was very dusty and dirty because it's tricky to clean concrete. The linens were always stained and only changed every 4 or so days. The towels either smelled of mothballs or overly perfumed soap. We would put our towels (that we had been using for many days) on the ground near the door to communicate that they were dirty (even leaving a note kindly asking for new ones) and they would be hung back up on the racks again. I stayed in one of the Surfer Suites and saw an enormous contrast between these and the other newer air conditioned rooms. I wish I knew there would have been such a drastic difference in quality for such a small price difference. 
The buffet food was repetitive and just tolerable. We were paying around $35 usd /day for just the food and I was shocked at how minimal it was for the price. We had pumpkin, rice and spinach every meal with the occasional fried chicken, veggie broth and noodles. Our fresh juice was half water. People became very ill a number of times throughout our stay here, including myself. Many of us opted out of eating at the buffet, despite already paying so much for it, and would eat for under 6$ at a high end restaurant up the road. For the type of event it was, healthier, unprocessed, not fried or boiled food would have been majorly appreciated. And variety - Bali is so abundant with many kinds of fresh fruits and vegetables and can easily be washed with clean water through your filter. 
Overall, the event itself was immensely gratifying, the location on the beach was beautiful, the studio was lovely.

"I'm 4 months pregnant. My husband and I knew this might be our last chance to holiday before the baby comes. So we wanted it to be special. Destination? (Easy...) Bali. But this time we want to experience the real face of Bali, not those we usually see in Kuta, Legian, etc.

Darius, a good friend since childhood happens to manage a hotel in Balian Beach called ""PONDOK PITAYA"". He invited us to stay at his place. So we thought why not...it's about 2-hour drive (with traffic time included) from Ngurah Rai airport with great scenic views. 

But boy...if I was impressed then...the moment we arrived at Pondok Pitaya I couldn't stop saying ""omg...wow"". It's (honestly) nothing like the photos posted on their website...it was WAY MORE BEAUTIFUL in real life!!! It's located right at the end of the of the road, touches the Balian Beach...so you get to eat (delicious & HEALTHY) food in their restaurant with killer view of the sea (and cool surfers)...as well as staying in beautiful wooden houses with rooftops rooms where you can stargaze, or staying at the River Suite where you have little ponds, garden and passionfruit growing on your porch. It was SO BEAUTIFUL and PEACEFUL! 

Darius recommended the River Suite and we fell in love at first sight. The room was simple, but it's just so clean, smells good, sweet, homey, cozy and got all the necessary (strategically positioned) ports to plug your electrical stuff as well as air conditioner just in case the weather gets too hot or humid. The room looks more like a little hut and made of boat woods. It's strong and sturdy but apparently it can float on water (in case of flood or tsunami, knock on wood). Anyway, we felt home. The room also feature orthopaedic bed, which again for a pregnant woman with bad back like myself, is very very helpful!

Everyone in Balian seems to know each other well, you will feel like you're actually part of the village community. We ended up changing our itinerary so that on the last day we could come back to Balian. Staffs and services are great, the place is filled with beautiful souls! And did I mention the massage???? This lady named Iluh, gave me a prenatal massage on the bale-bale next to the beach and honestly, it was the ""massage of my life"". So therapeutic for the body and the soul. Pondok Pitaya also provides yoga classes, taught by this beautiful kind lady named Bianca. If you feel like morning walk around the villages, you can ask her to show you the way....I did and she showed me this peaceful secluded beach nearby, it was worth it!!
 
When you're there don't forget to try the in-house food and their homemade apple cider ""JITU"". There are various menu, and Vegetarian friendly. Oh and one last thing...MUST DO hiking + waterfall tour! Went to enjoyed this secluded Blah Mantung waterfall, and it was just so serene and breathtaking, all to ourselves!! If you're a coffee fan, you could also visit the little LUWAK COFFEE factory in Pupuan and do some coffee tasting, as well as drink their herbal teas.

Overall, my husband and I truly recommended this place. It is far from the hustle and bustle of the ""modern Bali"", but it is worth it, especially if your main purpose of going to Bali is to relax. There are no sellers around the beach so don't worry about being bothered while you sunbathe.

Lastly, thank you very much Pondok Pitaya for giving us the experience of our life...thank you for reminding us again the real beautiful face of Bali.","{""stay_date"": ""2015-03-31"", ""trip_type"": ""couples""}",Experience the real true face of Bali here!!!,[],5,en,"{""name"": ""Audrey Singgih"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/29/53/aud33y.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Jakarta"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 294229, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Jakarta, Indonesia""}, ""username"": ""audreysinggih"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""38BBD4920BB27C9B73861116D5E1371F"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/audreysinggih"", ""contribution_count"": 37}",261834285,3,Must try their homemade apple cider &quot;Jitu&quot;...THE BOMB!

"This is a great place to go. It's got everything you could want from a holiday in Bali, without the crowds.

The hotel and its amenities (restaurant, pool, gardens, yoga studio) hold absolute prime beachfront position that cannot be beaten.  

I think that a real standout is their staff.  Every single one of them is always smiling and happy.  It's amazing, they are genuinely just happy people who will always greet you with warmth and kindness. They all speak very good English, and nothing is too much trouble. 

Beachfront rooms are traditional Indonesian in style, spacious, clean and have fans - more than enough because you have the sea breeze keeping you cool and comfortable.  There are some brand new air conditioned rooms out the back too, they look really nice.  

Restaurant has a chilled vibe, looking straight out onto the surf, with really good food - extensive menu selection of Indonesian and western food. 

Pool that overlooks the surf, with plenty of sunloungers and shade. 

New yoga studio overlooking the beach is pretty cool.  Two classes per day, or you can just go in there anytime and do your thing.  Sprawling, well kept gardens and grass area, with some huts that are perfect for chilling out in and watching the ocean.

Balian is a cool little surf town, like stepping back in time, but in a very good way. Away from the maddening crowds and ridiculous over-development and hype of Kuta, Seminyak, Canggu etc, it is one of the last slices of real paradise in Bali.  Well worth the couple of hours drive to come up. It's a very chilled village, not the place if you want loud night-time entertainment into the small hours of the morning, this is a place to relax, slow down and enjoy life

There is a really good, consistent wave right out the front of Pondok Pitaya. Balian is a semi-secret spot, which is a good thing, because it means less crowds and more chilled vibes. Just don't go telling everyone about it!

Make sure you catch a Balian sunset sitting at the restaraunt or the pool with Bintang in hand.  It's something to behold.

Many people come back to Pondok Pitaya year after year.  Once you have been here, it's not hard to see why.  You'll probably end up as one of them!","{""stay_date"": ""2015-03-31"", ""trip_type"": ""solo""}","Great beachront hotel in paradise.

"Out from the crowd of Bali, alongside the Balian beach in the west of the island, I found this place very nice with a heartwarming view of a virgin shore, ocean, and best for the sunset, also the breeze.

The wave was a good looking one from the side, but when I surf up well its quite big, I mean its very huge man, and I'm quite proud to be able to last for half an hour in the water. Well, I'm the one as an amateur surfer around the pros there.

The food also taste really good. First day I arrived there at night with a starving tummy, I was welcomed by their very friendly manager also the staffs, served a dinner by the manager with pizza, cocktails, and of course the very best yet unforgettable taste of their chicken curry (this was real good for me and I'm already starving just to think of that). By the way, their ""Nasi Goreng"" was also  perfect, I ate that menu for breakfast 2 days in a row.

The cottage was really unique, with a traditional Javanese culture furnitures made of wood, I found it to be really warm and pleasant in ambience.
The best experience I've got when I went to sleep while enjoyed the sound of the shore from distance, two nights I slept in real peace there.

Really worth to visit even it takes 90 mins from Kuta, and definitely will come back!","{""stay_date"": ""2014-10-31"", ""trip_type"": ""solo""}",another serenity alongside the shore,"[""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/b1/84/e5/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/b1/85/09/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/b1/85/14/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/b1/85/2f/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/b1/85/49/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg""]",5,en,"{""name"": ""Alvin"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/b1/8a/58/alvin-a.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Jakarta"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 294229, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Jakarta, Indonesia""}, ""username"": ""AlvinAlexander899"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""8FC440D95AABE28D49E74E2908064D11"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlvinAlexander899"", ""contribution_count"": 7}",233141641,4,,"[{""name"": ""rooms"", ""label"": ""Rooms"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""location"", ""label"": ""Location"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 5}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r233141641-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Dear Alvin, \n\nThank you for your testimonial, it was nice to have you around and knowing you treat our staff very nicely (you swept all my girls away haha).

"Actually this is not my first time staying at Pondok Pitaya. A few months ago I spent a night in the River House. The room was too big for only me & my mom (they have 4 or 5 beds if Im not mistaken). It was rustic but nice tho. And eventho there's no aircon, it's quite breezy at night and it's so nice to sleep with the sound of the waves.

Last weekend me & one of my friend came back and stayed at the new river suite. For me personally, the room was so much more comfortable (and they have aircon :)), bathroom also nicer, has cold & hot shower as well. We dined at the resto and they have varies of healthy meals. The staffs were also very friendly & helpful. Overall it was lovely !

The thing I love the most is that they have the best view. Facing the Balian Beach, and they have a very beautiful garden too ! You can just chill at the resto watching the waves, surf, go for a jog on the beautiful black sand beach, get massage, hang out at the pool etc. Such a great place to relax. (just a little note : maybe need to put more lighting around the pool coz it's pretty dark at that area)

We joined the yoga class in the morning with Ms McKall and really enjoyed it ! The price (IDR 125k) was including the yoga mat and a cup of hot tea. In the afternoon we also took the waterfall trip (also arranged by the hotel) and it was AMAZING ! :D

It might take quite a while to get to Balian (around 90-120 mins from the airport). But once you get there, it is totally worth it. If you're looking for a peaceful getaway, especially if you come from a big city, this is totally the perfect place !

"We recently spent 5 days at Pondok Pitaya in a Surfer Suite. This is a great spot its at the end of Balian Beach Road and its a great location to chill out and watch the surf and the sunset over a black sand beach. Our room was the basic Surfer Suite, huge king size bed and a nice big, although rustic room. The pillows were thin, as were the towels and the water pressure and hot water were quite bad. We had quite a bit of noise from the restaurant as were in suite 3. We chatted to the staff about this and were shown the  river suites as an alternative. As i have a dodgy foot we decided to stay where we were as one of the rooms had steep stairs and the other was dearer and faced away from the surf also they were very small. The positives about our room was the view, the size of the room and the bed. Breakfast was included and it was just ok.
This is a lovely place to stay for surfers like my husband and nonsurfers like myself. It was safe, very beautiful and we totally relaxed. We had a lovely massage outside overlooking the beach on a late afternoon. All in all its a great place to stay, i would stay again in one of the larger joglos as they looked amazing.","{""stay_date"": ""2014-08-31"", ""trip_type"": ""couples""}",Spectacular views - Chilled and Worth a Visit,[],4,en,"{""name"": ""simi07"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/86/e2/25/simi07.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Gold Coast"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 255337, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Gold Coast, Australia""}, ""username"": ""simi07"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""6B03557AAABA5F120FD0247AA2BD5F61"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simi07"", ""contribution_count"": 2084}",221693849,0,Surfer Suite 3 can be noisy from the Restaurant next door.

"It is far from the heart of Bali, yes, but now I get it why people would go this far... for surfer, the Balian Beach is paradise and was clearly made for you guys. The sand is not white and sandy, the beach is not typical one for you to lay down and get suntanned (methinks), but I had a great time jogging in the late afternoon during the low-tide. The weather was perfect with a great cliff view in front of me. It was clean and serene and I just loved it.

To me the hotel was awesome as well, it's nothing too fancy but obviously not crappy at all. It has this chilled, tranquil, and down-to-earth ambiance. You just feel like home. I love the all the food I had for lunch and 'em smoothies were really good! The pizzas we had for dinner was really nice too. Breakfast menu could be better though. The room was clean and spacious and I think it's worth the money. They have the non-AC and AC room (new ones) and everything is wooden-material. They also have yoga class on the weekend if I remember correctly. And last but not least, a very friendly and hands on manager, Darius! 

So to me it was really a great stay and leaves a good memory. I would definitely come back for some quite time. I gotta tell you this place is not for you who look for party time or even some time to hang out outside the hotel, it's pretty secluded with only street food stalls outside, I think it's a bit far from the Tabanan city (if you wish to go out). So if you're looking for a quality peace and quite time with a beach, Pondok Pitaya in Balian is the place to go!","{""stay_date"": ""2014-07-31"", ""trip_type"": ""family""}","A Different Side of Bali, A Peaceful Holiday","[""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/55/a5/e0/facade.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/55/a5/e1/pool.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/55/a5/e2/room.jpg""]",5,en,"{""name"": ""Stephany J"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg"", ""hometown"": null, ""username"": ""StephanyJ779"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""832630D64FC88E2A3908BBB9B6068C27"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanyJ779"", ""contribution_count"": 6}",220210032,0,,"[{""name"": ""value"", ""label"": ""Value"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""rooms"", ""label"": ""Rooms"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 4}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r220210032-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Hi Stephany,\n\nThank you for dropping by to our hotel and staying the night here.

"For a person like me who lives in a big-hectic-cluttered city and deals with the noises from work and my surroundings on a daily basis, staying here was truly a getaway. Located at Tabanan (2 hours from Ngurah Rai), here I found peace, where the sounds only came from the ocean and the chatters of the guests. 

I stayed for a night with my sister at the surfer suite bungalow. It was clean and comfy, a bit chill at night. The bathroom was also clean (and spacious too!).

On arrival the check in was a breeze and the River Villa I booked was great, 5 single kings with mossie nets, functional kitchen, great bathroom, super views and the best outside area to sit, drink bintangs and watch the surf. 
Everyday we'd surf, have breakfast which was really good and then enjoy the facilities at the hotel, before surfing some more. At night the only noise was the breaking of the waves.

"My boyfriend and I have recently returned from an amazing stay at Pondok Pitaya...

The hotel staff were brilliant, nothing was ever too much trouble, they were always so helpful, warm and caring.  

The hotel location is perfect - right on the beach! The food was really tasty and great value.  The rooms were clean and I always felt incredibly safe and well looked after.

I took several yoga classes with a free ice tea and was very impressed with the quality of the instructing and setting of the classes.

The surf was amazing, lovely long left hand waves (and some rights if you wanted them). I longboard and my boyfriend surfs a short board and we were both really happy with the conditions...plenty of waves to go round! 

We were also very impressed with how friendly the local people were.  A very lovely and talented local photographer from the nearby Balian beach bar (Made Dolly) took some amazing shots of us surfing for a very reasonable price, which meant that we have captured some great memories to bring home with us.

I can not praise this hotel and the staff enough...we will definitely be going back as soon as we can.","{""stay_date"": ""2014-04-30"", ""trip_type"": ""couples""}",Perfect place to surf and unwind,"[""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/66/c5/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/66/d5/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/66/e7/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/66/f2/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/67/04/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/67/16/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/67/25/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/67/2f/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/67/4b/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/67/7d/pondok-pitaya-hotel-surfing.jpg""]",5,en,"{""name"": ""MelPerks"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/d1/6a/02/melperks.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Perranporth"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 528866, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Perranporth, United Kingdom""}, ""username"": ""MelPerks"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""3BF74905050BF55EA50212A4E52AA1ED"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelPerks"", ""contribution_count"": 12}",204096661,2,"Request Room 1b if you are a couple...it&#39;s beautiful and has the most space.

"I stayed at a bungalow in Pondok Pitaya hotel for 10 days over Dec - Jan period. The bungalow was built in a traditional style which was very charming, it was a clean and cool place surrounded by a beautiful garden.  The double bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and had a hot shower.

I had a few meals at the hotel restaurant which has a good selection of Indonesian and western meals on the menu, they were of high quality and were delicious.  I would highly recommend the yellow curry and a veggie wrap.  The fresh fruit juices were also fantastic and I particularly enjoyed the watermelon juice with lime.

There are a variety of activities on offer, surfing is always an option and if you're not a surfer you can take yoga classes or sunbath by the pool among other activities.  The massages offered through the hotel were very good ( I've had 4 from 3 different masseuses!).  The experience of having the massages at a gazebo by the beach was truly magnificent.  There are also beach walks to different bays and a night market to explore with various local food options.

If you're looking for a real holiday out of the hustle and bustle of Denpasar, I would highly recommend Pondok Pitaya, it is in a tranquil little village with a friendly community feel, the staff at the hotel were wonderful and they go out of their way to make sure you're comfortable and at ease.

We both hired out the bungalow down the end of the resort closest to the river which easily sleeps 5 people. The Bungalow is 3 stories high, so the view I had of the swell from the second floor was absolutely perfect. The sound of the waves and the cool sea breeze were great to fall asleep to as well. 
The restaurant wasnt too bad either, The food was delicious, i recommend giving their yellow curry a go. The service was great too and the staff there were very nice and polite, also very easy to get along with.

"My boyfriend and I have been to Balian in either June/July/August for the last four years and stayed at Pondok Pitaya every time. We can't go to Bali without going up to Balian because the waves are so fun and our whole experience there is always amazing.  Pondok Pitaya is hands down the best accommodation in terms of location; you can see the surf from your window, as well as when you're in the pool or eating breakfast. Although the price reflects this (we have noticed the prices have gone up each year), it is still not an expensive place (and I'm a student!) and definitely worth what you pay...especially when it's a matter of $10 or so extra compared to other places. The rooms are spacious with large beds and a nice stone bathroom. The one annoying thing we found was the dimness of light; I can't remember having this problem in previous years so maybe it was just the bulb running out, but we had to use a phone torch a lot of the time. 
Each room has it's own little porch which was great after coming back from a surf; dumping our boards and hanging out all our wet stuff before feasting. The food at this hotel is fine however check out Deki's warung which has really nice food and is just up the hill overlooking the water so has a great view too, and Pondok Pisces has amazing banana pancakes! If you walk in to town between 5:30-7 pm (I could be wrong about this time; best to check with someone else) there are local markets which have really cheap, delicious food. 
I've never stayed with a group here but I remember being shown the wooden house/hut that groups stay in and it was awesome! Also I'm not sure if the yoga is a new thing to the hotel but I have never noticed it or been told about it, I'm definitely keen to give it a shot next time I come up though :) 
The atmosphere at Pondok Pitaya is great, everyone is really friendly (both staff and visitors) and always smiling. The music they play is generally pretty good (apart from one night when hectic club music was being played) but the rest of the time made up for that! One night an Aussie dude that lives in Balian (I forgot your name sorry!) played live music which was amazing!

I would definitely recommend (and have recommended) Pondok Pitaya and Balian in general to anyone! Its a great place and it would be extremely hard to go there and not have an amazing time.","{""stay_date"": ""2013-06-30"", ""trip_type"": ""couples""}",Addictive!,"[""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/8d/54/bb/pondok-pitaya-surfer.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/8d/54/c6/pondok-pitaya-surfer.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/8d/54/d3/pondok-pitaya-surfer.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/8d/54/dd/pondok-pitaya-surfer.jpg"", ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/8d/55/dc/pondok-pitaya-surfer.jpg""]",5,en,"{""name"": ""Jess192"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/8e/48/5b/jess192.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Perth"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 255103, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Perth, Australia""}, ""username"": ""Jess192"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""4979B706881A1FB8B01C85EB27EA9193"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jess192"", ""contribution_count"": 7}",177661151,1,,"[{""name"": ""value"", ""label"": ""Value"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""rooms"", ""label"": ""Rooms"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""location"", ""label"": ""Location"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""sleep_quality"", ""label"": ""Sleep Quality"", ""rating"": 5}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r177661151-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Hi Jess,\n\nThank you for your detailed testimonial, apology for the music hehehe must be one of those nights. we will put your input into the hotel's feed back.\n\nWe hope to see you next year!!\n\n- Pondok Pitaya -"", ""language"": ""en"", ""response_id"": 179140953, ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DSadeli"", ""published_date"": ""2013-09-30"", ""avatar_image_link"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg"", ""connection_to_place"": ""Manager""}",2013-09-18,en,2013-09-18,,,,

"This place has a lot going for it. Location right on the beach. Charming, clean rooms with a 1950s feel to them. Modern, funky bathrooms with a view across the fields while you take a (warm) shower. And a lovely pool right on the edge of the sand. The mosquito nets are robust and red. The breeze through the room when the doors are open is cooling and welcome.

Surfers are catered for with racks for their boards. Yoga is on offer in mornings in wonderful pavillions overlooking the crashing surf.

My main issue with this property in the bar / restaurant attached. It's an integral part of the place and so does have a big impact. The food quality was consistently poor (nasi goreng without an egg??); the music was bad (awful fake-reggae-pop or cover versions of Adele); and someone had added a rope of flashing rope of coloured LEDs. It is such a shame as the furniture, position and overall feel are really something special. This is why those in the know take a few steps down onto the black sand beach and head to the simple little place on the rocks to the right to have their sunset beer and feed.

I really like this place and they seem to be trying really hard to make a go of it. My advice - sort out the bar / restaurant (especially the music which made me seek out another place to have my beers); find a way to have front of rooms open to the breeze at night (perhaps louvre windows?); chill out a little and decide if you want to be a surfer place or a yoga place. At the moment its kind of neither with a bit of naff Kuta thrown in.","{""stay_date"": ""2013-07-31"", ""trip_type"": ""friends""}","Lots to love, a few niggles.",[],4,en,"{""name"": ""SybariteCK"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Braidwood"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 528929, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Braidwood, Australia""}, ""username"": ""SybariteCK"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""77BB9C4BC7008BC14C79188F7BAD295F"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SybariteCK"", ""contribution_count"": 31}",170361301,0,Large rooms for families / groups are also available.,"[{""name"": ""value"", ""label"": ""Value"", ""rating"": 3}, {""name"": ""rooms"", ""label"": ""Rooms"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""location"", ""label"": ""Location"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""sleep_quality"", ""label"": ""Sleep Quality"", ""rating"": 3}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r170361301-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Hi SyBarite,\n\nThank you for staying in our hotel.

"We stayed at the Pondok Pitaya for four nights as part of our journey around most of the island.  We had booked the Joglo Room and it provided a spacious and relaxing natural retreat for my husband and myself and another couple we were travelling with. The Joglo has hot water (albeit temperamental at times), fan-cooled rooms, a beautiful Balinese interior, spare day beds and an amazing ocean-front view. It is very open and not at all sound proof, so you would need to stay there with family or very close friends. The Pondok Pitaya restaurant was generally good value as were the others doted along the main entry.  The Garden Cafe was a nice place to eat but be prepared for long waits at dinner time.  Not that this bothered us, as once it gets dark in Pondok Pitaya, there isn't an awful lot to do.  But that is part of the appeal of Balian; it is quiet, basic and secluded, free from the hustle and bustle of other parts of Bali. During the day the men enjoyed the close proximity of the surf and my friend and I read, swum in the lovely pool and explored the hill and beyond.  I would recommend Pondok Pitaya to anyone who isn't looking for high rise resort accomodation and loves the surf.  It is a beautiful and unspoilt part of Bali.","{""stay_date"": ""2012-07-31"", ""trip_type"": ""friends""}",Pondok Pitaya Take 2,[],5,en,"{""name"": ""Kerry2009"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Perth"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 255103, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Perth, Australia""}, ""username"": ""Jacjur"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""E341B87AB2D993B359B9E4E5AFF3889E"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacjur"", ""contribution_count"": 81}",136812417,0,,"[{""name"": ""value"", ""label"": ""Value"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""rooms"", ""label"": ""Rooms"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""location"", ""label"": ""Location"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""sleep_quality"", ""label"": ""Sleep Quality"", ""rating"": 4}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r136812417-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Thanks for the great review!! we really appreciate it..\n\nlook forward to see you again\n\n- Pondok Pitaya Management -"", ""language"": ""en"", ""response_id"": 151503043, ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DSadeli"", ""published_date"": ""2013-02-06"", ""avatar_image_link"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg"", ""connection_to_place"": ""Manager""}",2012-08-10,en,2012-08-11,,,,
"We had booked to stay here 2 nights to go surfing but left early due to inclement weather.  Due to a mix up with our original booking, we ended up staying in the River House. Downstairs was a small kitchen, bathroom and lovely alfresco area.  Middle level had 4 single beds and toilet and there was a loft up top with a mattress. It was pretty much open to the elements.
There were alot of mosquito's being so close to the river and only one mosqito net for the 5 beds.  The idea for the house was good with a great view to the ocean from the sleeping area, however, to lug suitcases up a ladder to the bedroom area was impractical, so we left them down in the kitchen .  We had luch here one day which was nice and very reasonably priced.  
It certainly has the best location in Balian, but it was a tad expensive, seeing there were no mod cons and only cold water showers.","{""stay_date"": ""2012-07-31"", ""trip_type"": ""family""}","Great location, but pick your room",[],3,en,"{""name"": ""LeeLou64"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/bb/14/06/leelou64.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Perth"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 255103, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Perth, Australia""}, ""username"": ""LeeLou64"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""1900D96FC286A0E94AF45F3495038F69"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeLou64"", ""contribution_count"": 1503}",135336057,0,,"[{""name"": ""value"", ""label"": ""Value"", ""rating"": 3}, {""name"": ""rooms"", ""label"": ""Rooms"", ""rating"": 3}, {""name"": ""location"", ""label"": ""Location"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""sleep_quality"", ""label"": ""Sleep Quality"", ""rating"": 3}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r135336057-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,"{""text"": ""Thank you so much for your review..\n\nand we are so sorry for the mosquitos...all bed are all equip with mosquito nets now.\n\nwe are constantly increasing our standards...\n\nlook forward for your next visit!!\n\n- Pondok Pitaya Management -"", ""language"": ""en"", ""response_id"": 151503188, ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DSadeli"", ""published_date"": ""2013-02-06"", ""avatar_image_link"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg"", ""connection_to_place"": ""Manager""}",2012-07-25,en,2012-07-26,,,,

"This is just a review of the restaurant at Pondok Pitaya, as we have a home in the area and no need for accommodation. We are expats who built our home off Balian Beach about 16 years ago; at that time, other than the nearby bus stop Soka Indah (which has great Nasi Goreng fyi), there were only a few restaurants (one of which is close by to Pondok Pitaya--Gaja Minah; fabulous French/Indonesian food and good wine choices).

Today the area is becoming well known for its surfing and several B&B's have sprung up,along with accompanying restaurants to our delight. There are several little surfer restaurants on this beach now and by far, our favorite two are Pondok Pitaya and Pondok Pisces. Both of these restaurants are usually packed (during high season you might even want to call to make a reservation, although if you are not in a hurry, you can hang out at the beach until there is an available table).  

We love going to Pondok Pitaya to eat, no matter breakfast, lunch or dinner. To start with, the restaurant is right off the beach and the view is stunning.  You can get acceptable wi-fi (a one time fee of Rupiah 50,000 allows you to get their wi-fi access for a good duration of time--we recently went daily for over two weeks with the same access password), so you can get online, eat and drink, all while enjoying a panoramic oceanfront view. 

The menu is really good comfort/diner-style food. The chicken wings are to die for (and come with chunky, crispy fries with just the right amount of salt), the hamburgers are very satisfying (one of the only restaurants in the area to serve them so even more satisfying to have access to them!),  guacamole/bean dip w/chips are great (avocados are seasonal...), the burritos very filling (and high on the carb side if you are a surfer who needs the calories--a bit much for a couch potato...), the fresh fruit smoothies are refreshing, the iced ginger tea is powerful (try it w/o sugar if you really want a kick...), and the BBQ whatever is always fantastic (although a few times the BBQ itself has been broken, so ask ahead of time). There is almost always daily fresh fish and of course a variety of local soups/noodles/rice/curry dishes.  

As for drinks, Bintang beer is always available (and a safe choice). I wouldn't trust ordering cocktails here with vodka/gin, etc. as the brands used are likely also to be local (watchout for the hangover...). Sometimes wine by the glass is available and there are actually a couple of bearable local (Australian joint ventures) wines...they are great about asking to just try a sip first. We bring our own wine and there is no corkage charge (yet...let's hope the place doesnt' become TOO popular so this and other fab oceanfront perks disappear or are charged for....). 

Finally, the staff is very friendly  and as one person has mentioned, reactive. However, they are quick to provide service once you do approach them. Considering you are still out in the middle of relative nowhere, this is a fantastic little beachfront restaurant.","{""stay_date"": ""2012-06-30"", ""trip_type"": ""couples""}",Fab comfort food on the beach!,[],5,en,"{""name"": ""Carol W"", ""avatar"": ""https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e6/cb/84/asiaexpat81.jpg"", ""hometown"": {""location_name"": ""Kuala Lumpur"", ""tripadvisor_entity_id"": 298570, ""location_name_detailed"": ""Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia""}, ""username"": ""Asiaexpat81"", ""is_verified"": false, ""reviewer_id"": ""24076CC2DCF320E9BBCFA23355C51495"", ""profile_link"": ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Asiaexpat81"", ""contribution_count"": 133}",133409578,1,,"[{""name"": ""value"", ""label"": ""Value"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""location"", ""label"": ""Location"", ""rating"": 5}, {""name"": ""cleanliness"", ""label"": ""Cleanliness"", ""rating"": 4}, {""name"": ""service"", ""label"": ""Service"", ""rating"": 5}]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608496-d1985543-r133409578-Pondok_Pitaya_Hotel_Surfing_and_Yoga-Tabanan_Bali.html,False,,2012-07-04,en,2012-07-05,,,,
