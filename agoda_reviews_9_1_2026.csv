Francoise,Indonesia,Two-Bedroom Villa,1,8.4,"It’s our second time staying here. We love that it’s right on the beach. Food was quite good ..We had minor issues like the toilet flush didn’t work properly, the pool looked like it hadn’t been cleaned but maybe because it’s the rainy season so it looked a bit dirty. But overall it was a good staycation.","December 11, 2025"
Raphaël,United Kingdom,1 Bedroom Suite,5,8.8,"A most amazing spot for a relaxed getaway from the chaos that has dominated most of Bali's beaches. This hotel is right by the break, perfect for surfers and beach lovers alike.

The staff are very kind and welcoming and always at your service. The grounds are really well thought out and can often times be quite majestic to walk around in. Finally, for the rooms, they are well designed with comfortable beds, however, it's a real shame that the walls are paper thin so if you have neighbors, you can hear everything that happens in the next room, even whispers.

But, all in all, a great getaway!","January 08, 2025"
andrew,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,3,9.6,"This place was great. Ticked both boxes. Yoga for my girlfriend and surfing for me. 
Great location with a great restaurant. 
There are a few other places to eat around and about and some touristy things to fill in a few days. The pool was pretty nice as well. 
If we go back to Balian we would definitely stay there again. 
Couple of things. 
Rooms need a fan and a fridge. Upstairs room had a really nice breeze.","May 31, 2025"
tomomi,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Suite,2,8.8,"Good: 
It’s in front of surf spot .
Looking ocean pool and restaurant nice garden . They got new sauna
Lovely Indonesia style 
Friendly staff
I would go back to stay again 

Bad:
We stayed standard twin room no fridge 
The  room and bathroom quite small 
Food and beverages expensive","August 11, 2025"
Liesl,South Africa,1 Bedroom Suite,4,8.0,"Possibly the best location in Balian for surfing. And if you are not surfing then best spot to be able to lie at the pool and watch the surf.

Rooms are neat and cute but walls are thin; so with neighbours on either side and/or above, it can get a bit noisy. 

Staff are super helpful, massage is excellent and although we didn’t try the yoga this time, previously it was great!","June 06, 2025"
公司,Japan,2 Bedroom Villa with Ocean View Pool 1,5,10.0,"I stayed in August 2023. Since there was only one room left, we used a discount to stay in an 8-person room (Room No. 9) for two people. The cleaning was done thoroughly every day, and if you looked up as soon as you left the room, you could see a perfect starry sky; right in front was a surf point, making the location amazing! The staff were all young and friendly, and they were willing to help with anything. The daily yoga sessions had a wonderful location and the instructor was great, making me feel like my inner force was awakening. Once I received a massage, I became hooked; the cost performance was so good that I got one every day. Additionally, the food at the inn's restaurant was delicious, so there was no need to go out. I had a slight concern about the drainage in the toilet and shower, but thanks to them, I was able to enjoy a luxurious stay that made those worries insignificant. I want to go back to this place.",N/A
Mike,United States,1 Bedroom Suite,1,10.0,"This place is really exceptional! Right on the beach in Balian, the perfect place to surf, practice yoga, and get away from the Bali crowds. The food is the best I have had in Bali, the prices are reasonable, and they will accommodate allergies/special diets. The staff are super friendly and accommodating, and the rooms are comfy. Most definitely worth the trip up to Balian from Southern Bali😃","March 04, 2025"
Keith,Australia,Family for 4,8,8.8,"Great week for a family of 4 with a baby and a toddler. My wife and I both got our share of waves with good babysitting options and good food. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
Pool is a bit beat up and needs re-tiling but does the job.
Would be nice if breakfast/coffee was served a bit earlier. 8 is when it’s served now but surfers/families are usually up earlier…
There are a few swings and a little play structure with a grassy area for kids to play on. We will come with another family on our next trip so kids have a bit more to do.","October 27, 2024"
Callum,Australia,Family for 4,4,8.0,"Stunning location and amazing staff. We loved our time at Pondok Pitaya. The food in the restaurant was delicious (try to chicken stay sticks), tasty cocktails, a wave right out the front and great massages for 200,000 Rupiah ($20AUD).

A number of the pool tiles are coming up and the room was sandy in places with rubbish from previous holidaymaker under the bed so they could be a bit more thorough and do a bit of maintenance in places. The rooms are old school which makes the place special but bathrooms a bit dark and dingey. Hubby thought it was spectacular though so different tastes. Our room was massive and has beach views. 

So much space for the kids to play too. We would absolutely stay again. The staff were all so friendly and happy. Thank you for a fabulous stay!","July 14, 2024"
Kathleen,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,14,10.0,"Pondok Pitaya is a gem. It's a few hours drive from the airport, but once you arrive, all is right with the world. The hotel is right on the beach and the surf action. The food is fantastic, the pool is great for a dip to cool off, and there are two yoga classes a day and massage facilities on site. The staff are extremely welcoming. Sunsets are spectacular and without the instagram crowd. All in all a great little getaway.","September 13, 2024"

Ariel,Israel,1 Bedroom Suite,2,9.6,"We had a great stay at Pitaya. It has the best location in all of Balian, right in front of the surf peak with beach accrss. The breakfast was very tasty and with great hours for surfers returning from a morning session.  The room was nice and the pool area is amazing for chilling after the surf. They have 2 beautiful yoga shala with one being right in front of the ocean. Would greatly recommend staying there!","September 10, 2023"
Martin,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,5,8.8,"We had a river room, number 2 which was beach front. Great location we could check the surf from our room. There are only a few double rooms at the front so I would request one of these when booking. The shower was hit and miss but we got by. Everything else great","November 17, 2024"

CRAIG,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,1,10.0,"Absolutely love this place, been here many times & will come many more😁
Only suggestion is the stairs up to D8 and A8 are now quite old and are cracked and rickety. I think someone is going to have a nasty accident unless they are replaced many thanks","November 06, 2024"
Mick,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,5,9.6,"The best affordable accomodation in Balian hands down. Rooms are good, the location is as close as you can get to the surf.

The restaurant food was the only let down, it was really disappointing. Luckily there's plenty of other places to eat nearby.","October 23, 2024"
Ross,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,4,10.0,"Outstanding accommodation right on the beach. Beautiful and authentic ‘pondok’ style room, friendly and helpful staff on every level. The food was delicious and very affordable.

Elena,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Suite,1,3.6,"We stayed for a night and were really disappointed with quality of the room. We paid 655000 rupiah for sleeping in a dirty room: sheets were grey with some spots, duvet was grey from previous guests I guess. Toilet is dirty too with poor curtain which is not secured on hangers. Door is closed with a wooden stick which falls apart when you touch it.","August 27, 2022"
jhon,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,2,6.4,"The room was clean ,air-conditioned cold,good hot water,  big gaps in doors that a lizard could get through padlock for a lock,electric jug but no tea or coffee provided,no fridge, no TV,  fresh drinking water in a jug for two days but it was on the beach with good surf,one small pool.surfers/ backpackers style.","August 02, 2022"

Joshua,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,2,9.2,"Love Pondok Pitaya, the restaurant is fantastic, good staff and the location perfect. Only issue I had was that the rooms offer no noise privacy, you can hear the entire conversations of your neighbour (at least in some rooms). Otherwise it's perfect here.","June 05, 2022"
Bram,Netherlands,1 Bedroom Suite,3,9.6,Perfect if you want to be right by the break.,"June 03, 2022"
Robert,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Suite,4,7.6,"Reception staff are accomodating as well as welcoming, the arrival brief was comprehensive which allowed us to get the most from our stay. Accommodation is a little tired and the rooms a little gloomy inside however this makes it feel cooler in the heat of the day. Rooms are well appointed although there is no fridge which I would put as an essential in this climate. The restaurant we rarely used as the staff were difficult to grab the attention of (stuck on phones, chatting to each other, not watching the dining area) which became frustrating, however there are a couple of restaurants near by behind the resort that I would thoroughly recommend. This is predominantly","May 23, 2022"
Richard,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Suite,2,8.8,"Definitely for the younger set, good restaurant,  ok rooms, great location.","March 27, 2021"
Zbigniew,Poland,1 Bedroom Suite,1,7.2,"...cleanliness! We booked 2 rooms and both had really ugly stains on bedsheets/bedcovers. This was very surprising experience, as everything else was quite nice! Please teach your staf to always check if there are any stains on the sheets and -if so- not to put these as fresh sheets! Also there was a mouldy smell to both of the rooms. Need to be ventilated better. 

Other than that: lovely location, nice food, yoga was great, great area + great for surfers.","February 21, 2020"
Alexandra,Canada,1 Bedroom Suite,4,10.0,"Situated way west on the coast of Bali Island, this place is the perfect hotel to relax. It is on the beach front, super clean, the food is very good and has a lot of variety and vegan/vegetarian options. The staff is great and you even have yoga and massages available at this institution. There is surf (intermediate-advance) right in front. Not to forget the pool!! The rooms are gorgeous and comfy. It has been my favorite place in Bali. It is situated in a small village, and there are not that many tourists. It is also easy to book a scooter if you wish to go on your own adventure 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻","January 18, 2020"
Elizabeth,United States,1 Bedroom Suite,2,10.0,"Beautiful rooms, easy access to the beach and convenient surfboard rentals rigby in front of the hotel.  The restaurant has amazing views of the ocean and the pool is lovely. We took several yoga classes and highly recommend staying here.","January 09, 2020"
Carolyn,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,3,6.8,"If surf and yoga are NOT your thing, then there are better options than Balian Beach. 

However, if it IS your thing, then this is definitely the place for you.

Pondok Pitaya was “ rustic” but clean.

Cheaper food options up the hill, but food was good.","November 17, 2019"
Liane,Canada,1 Bedroom Suite,2,8.0,This huge green property is at the end of the road where the beach begins. The restaurant overlooking the beach was great too. Amazing massage up the hill!,"October 31, 2019"
Dugald,Canada,1 Bedroom Suite,12,9.6,"This hotel is basically the hub of Balian, perched right in front of the local surf break that draws many of the visitors. The location is perfect, and you can watch the waves while you eat breakfast or sip a cocktail by the pool, so the setup is optimal for surfing families. 

If you expect a five-star resort you might be a little disappointed...the free breakfast is good but otherwise the restaurant is so-so. The rooms are rustic, with lots of character but you'll be sharing the space with ants and lizards. 

The surf break is great when it's on, but while we were there the swell was too big for much of our stay...it's 30 minutes by scooter to Medewi which holds up to a bigger swell. 

The staff are awesome, friendly and personable. We had a great time and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking for a charming, rustic and quiet visit to a chilled out slice of paradise.","October 30, 2019"
Julienne,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Suite,2,8.4,"Spectacular position, step onto the sand from the front lawn. Very rustic feel, however somewhat dated. The water in the pool needed attention. The grounds and gardens were well maintained with an interesting array of plants and waterfalls. Definitely geared towards the yoga retreat as well as surf accommodation.  Choice of three set menus for breakfast which was included in the price, they were all good. Would stay again.","October 24, 2019"
Will,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,2,10.0,"Authentic Balinese buildings in , laidback ambiance, top surf , and a beach and cliffs to explore ! What more could a person want .
Ample food is available at the hotel , also the sushi bar , Tony’s and a couple of beach bum bars , Relax in the pool or sit back and watch the waves .
The river rooms are great for 2 and are quaint.
A place the hasn’t been discovered yet .","September 05, 2019"
Indiah,N/A,1 Bedroom Suite,1,9.2,Traditional rooms with beautiful gardens. Pool looks right over surf break. Playground for children which was great. Breakfast option was lovely with room. Restaurant looks over beach also.  Will be staying here again..,"August 22, 2019"
Kim,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,3,10.0,"Great spot, lovely staff, massage in a  cabana by the beach was great, only fault I would say and that is just me and my husband food took around 45 min to come out each time, thats just the pace of the place we weren't use to I guess. the warungs up the road were quicker to bring food out we found.","August 18, 2019"
Suzanne,New Zealand,1 Bedroom Suite,8,7.2,Great location with surf break in front of  the Resort. The resort rooms are very basic. Very relaxing as no shops or TV.

michael,New Zealand,1 Bedroom Suite,11,8.4,The location is excellent being right on the water so you can check the surf first thing in the morning!

Daryl,N/A,1 Bedroom Suite,3,6.4,"I would have given this place a better rating, but then they ripped me off on check out. Never going back.","August 01, 2019"
Kristian,United States,1 Bedroom Suite,1,8.8,"Great ambiance! Absolutely loved the vibe of this place. Comfortable and beautiful! Had some issues with the shower. Hot water was run by gas and worked when it felt like it and at the end of our stay the water was struggling to even come out. Towels looked as they could have been change a couple years ago. At the breakfast that came with the room purchase, every item came with yogurt as a base which they were out of and there was no room for changes to other menu items. So breakfast was incomplete. One server on the staff was very indifferent to being there and seemed we were bothering her when we needed something. The remaining staff was amazing!","July 20, 2019"
Naomi,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,2,4.8,"We stayed with 2 children (5 and 7). Pros - pool was in a nice location, but a little cloudy, location of resort was the stand out feature, small playground & swings helped keep children entertained. 
Cons- Room was very dark (we had joining room with children). Rooms had a ‘fusty’ smell and needed airing, bedding was dusty (my son got hives from it), food at restaurant was expensive, took a long time to arrive and was served stone cold. Breakfast took over an hour to get to us after ordering- including coffees.","June 30, 2019"

Jamie,Indonesia,N/A,1,7.2,"such an awesome location, right on the beach in front of the surf break. the joglo that we stayed in was behind the pool, which is right beside the beach. love the beach, love the wave. fun place for kids to beach comb. that said, it seemed a bit more run down than our previous visit, and the service seemed quite lacking this time. for each meal we had about a 45 min wait for something simple, be it our drinks, or our kids food. one meal our hungriest kids food came out close to an hour after ordering, and was the wrong order. yikes (aka bring some snacks with you because there's no store nearby). they forgot a few things for our room like the baby crib, and they were doing an impromptu restaurant renovation throughout our stay there, complete with lots of banging and no ground clean-up while they were at it. anyway, awesome place overall (for the price anyway), but would be nice to see it get a little more love from management or staff","June 07, 2019"

Lyndall,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,4,9.6,"I stayed with my daughter and her young baby. It was a perfect place for us with its beautiful setting, lovely comfortable rooms and great facilities. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful and the food in the restaurant was outstanding.  The only difficulty we had was trying to get breakfast for the baby each morning with the restaurant not opening until 8am. The resort is not within walking distance of shops and there is no fridge in the room so it was a real challenge trying to keep a hungry baby happy from 5am until 8am. A small bar fridge in the room would have fixed the problem. Otherwise a really wonderful stay.","May 02, 2019"
Mark,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,3,5.6,"Then this is it, spectacular surfing, left and right handers.
The staff are first rate, very helpful. The food is ok with plenty of choice nearby.
The accommodation is very basic, if the rooms were from scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean, you will get my drift. Dark dank, mosquito infected .....
For us a downer, but then have a serious look, the surfing is top class.","May 01, 2019"
Sanjay,United States,N/A,1,6.8,"Overall, this is a nice setting and Pondok Pitaya grounds and atmosphere is quite nice.  It has decent amenities, and provides a different experience  than the Kuta madness. For IDR 1.4m, I expected better (1.1m + 0.3 in taxes) comparatively in terms of the villa we rented.  Some downsides:  the room did not have AC (which we did not realize) the interior was quite rustic and cinderblock, and the bathrooms in particular are not very well done (a bit prison like) . On the other hand, this probably keeps some people away.  Just saying it's not for everyone, but for us Alaskans (a fam of 4) it worked.  . I'd look at the place first to decide.","December 17, 2018"
Caroline,United Kingdom,1 Bedroom Suite,2,4.4,"There was no yoga classes throughout our stay, as we were told there were none for the foreseeable future","December 10, 2018"
Brent,Canada,1 Bedroom Suite,1,6.0,"- Showed up late & they never knew about reservation, but accommodated so not a huge deal
- No towels in room and had to ask for.
- Internet never worked in room as advertised.
- No yoga at all even though its right in their name
- As a place serving more vegetarians than usual (being a supposed yoga center), there wifi password is beefburger.  I find that a pretty clued out business move.
- Room mediocre for price
- Sent link after to ask for feedback and it never worked, hence I'm writing here instead
- Breakfast was great though.","December 10, 2018"

David,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,1,10.0,"This little gem is right on the beach, you can sit for hours watching the waves and the surfers in action. The staff are really friendly, the food is good and the Bintangs are icy cold. What more could you ask for.","November 20, 2018"
Belinda,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,5,7.2,"We enjoyed our stay, room was large enough, the airconditioning was ice cold. You can watch the sunset right from the pool!

Trudy,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,5,10.0,"We loved this place, very relaxing and chilled. The room was basic but all we needed with mosquito net and pedestal fan.  Aircon was great. The shower was a bit dodgy and there was no fridge, but we could live with that.  Our room was well located 1 minute from the pool and restaurant area and the beach. The breakfast and general food was awesome in the restaurant and there were many other options in close vicinity. 
Great waves daily, not crowded.  The yoga classes were well run.
Great beach walks.
Fully chilled, great vibe,  thoroughly recommend it.","October 23, 2018"

Jamie,Indonesia,N/A,2,8.0,"such an amazing spot. great surf. good yoga classes. Mellow vibes. no hustle bustle of busier bali spots. so ideal. it's fairly rustic, but suits the place just fine. not sure why they have those super tacky fluorescent trickling lights on the trees outside. a few patio lights would suit the atmosphere better. and breakfast should open earlier than 8 if its a surf and yoga spot. but now we're getting picky.","September 11, 2018"
NEIL,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,4,10.0,"The pondok Pitaya is one off the secluded place I Have ever rayed in Bali, if you what a place to relax unwind, it for you.

Kade,Australia,Villa (4 Adults),7,10.0,"I’ve been to Balian 10 times and stayed at Pondok 5 times. best place I have visited in Bali.

Paul,Oman,2 Bedroom Villa with Ocean View Pool 1,1,6.8,"Lovely location and great staff. Everything else was overrated. The pool was green and had tiles missing.  The bathrooms and kitchen were very poor, lots of plastic pipes that didn't work
 Had to ask three times for toiletries and ended up with only soap. Wouldn't mind if we weren't paying a top price. Very overrated and  very disappointing.","June 20, 2018"
Lorey,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,6,9.2,"Our second stay here. It’s a great spot to relax, I think what made it so relaxing was the lack of bartering everything is priced accordingly to main tourist areas and everything went straight to the bill we paid at the end including massages and a trip to the waterfalls. The staff are beautiful. I’d love to see a pool menu currently only drinks. The rooms were comfortable. The shower was a little temperamental between steaming hot and cold but it did the job. Also the pool water quality was needing a little attention if I’m being fussy. But those are just minor things in the whole picture it is a wonderful traditional Bali style accommodation.","June 13, 2018"
Ken,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,5,7.6,"Small hotel with great location and wonderful recycled timber work.
Meals were good and cheap. Pool was nice but pretty small. We had an upstairs room with stairs a mountain goat would have trouble climbing. The room was small but very pretty with all the recycled timber. Very peaceful place. No wi-fi in the rooms was quite annoying. The mattress was harder than a park bench. If you don’t surf, It is not the place to hang.","May 14, 2018"
ROBIN,United Kingdom,1 Bedroom Suite,1,10.0,Good location especially for surfing. Could not fault,"May 09, 2018"
Suzanne,United States,1 Bedroom Suite,3,9.6,"So mostly people hung in the dining area with it's great views of the sea, since no wifi in the rooms.  Gorgeous setting in the pool area","April 23, 2018"
Alastair,Indonesia,1 Bedroom Suite,1,5.2,Food and service  not good . But good position .,"March 07, 2018"
Louise,United Kingdom,1 Bedroom Suite,5,4.8,"The yoga classes that are advertised were not operating as normal due to New Year and a private yoga retreat taking place at the same time there. Of the 5 days we were there only 3 had classes available and these weren't in the normal nice yoga shala overlooking the ocean as it was taken up by the retreat group. The room it was held in was just an unventilated bedroom. The teacher was very good though. Sadly it feels like it was once a nice place but is tired now. Staff were very slow and it seemed that what little focus they had was for the retreat that was happening, with the restaurant being totally booked out for them a lot of the time for a buffet. The bedroom was nice with a comfy bed and good air con but our shower was broken when we arrived and it took 3 days to be fixed. The pool was murky every day we were there - not inviting. Music played in the restaurant was inappropriate a lot of the time with gangster rap in the middle of the day at a loud volume. Food was very average.","January 06, 2018"
Molly,United States,1 Bedroom Suite,6,8.8,"Lovely spot, friendly caring staff, great breakfast, quiet and away from the crowds. Wifi only in restaurant, can take 3 hours from airport if traffic is bad, the only inconveniences. A tiny little shop has lovely things. Loved this spot. Yoga available, as are massages, salon services, and surf lessons across the river.","December 28, 2017"
Frances,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,2,10.0,It’s pretty isolated. Only a small village nearby. 3hours drive north of Kuta. Bit that is what I wanted.. no tourists,"October 28, 2017"
Rod,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,4,8.8,"I really loved it clean stylised rooms great ambience Food staff and service was great. BUT!! Make sure you ask about the hot water when you check in and ask especially for a room where the Hot water works reliably. 
Great proximity to surf (straight in Front!) Great view of surf from pool and restaurant. Take your own media no TV. 
Don't think about anywhere else if you don't mind a cold shower great for surfers, but wives be warned about the hot water.","September 24, 2017"
Emily,New Zealand,1 Bedroom Suite,3,9.2,I really loved the vibe at this place.  Beautiful view right on the beach and helpful and friendly staff. Couldn't fault it.,"July 22, 2017"
Phillip,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,6,10.0,"Always exceptional here.
Last year we left behind some picture frames we bought, had never contacted them about this. When we arrived I told them we left them there last year. 5 minutes later they were in our hands.
Thank you so much.","June 12, 2017"
Jonny,United Kingdom,1 Bedroom Suite,2,9.2,"The rooms here are lovely! Staff were ok, not as friendly as we found everywhere else on the island but that might be just because everyone else sets such a high standard! Great quiet place with good surf, right on the beach. Restaurant options ok but awesome sushi bar next door. Few broken tiles in the swimming pool but lovely gardens and place is generally very well kept...would stay again!","May 24, 2017"
Jessi,Austria,1 Bedroom Suite,3,9.2,"I loved how i was able to wake up every morning to a delightful breakfast literally on the sand. You could not be any closer to the water. Yoga offerred twice a day, a sparkling clean pool, great aircon, great location, i wasnt able to surf in balian as the waves were much too heavy for my Longboard. But yoga classes are a must followed by relaxing by the pool. Wow. Just gorgeous grounds.","April 16, 2017"
Basile,France,1 Bedroom Suite,2,8.4,"Excellent rest for 5 days here.
The pickup driver from airport is one of the best I got (after many trips in Indo).

Virginia,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,3,9.6,"Pondok Pitaya is in a fabulous location with wonderful staff services & delicious food. 
My only 2 complaints are 1st world problems. The website said wifi in all areas; in reality, sporadic wifi is only available in the restaurant area. And the water pressure in our room was less than suitable for washing long hair. As we were there only a couple of days & not going out anywhere fancy, the pool did a great job of rinsing the days heat out (no shampoo or conditioner required)
On the up side, the Balinese Circulation massage was Amazing!!!!! wish I hadn't left it till the last night to enjoy it.","November 27, 2016"
Bridget,New Zealand,1 Bedroom Suite,5,9.6,Although our room smelt of strongly of mildew we loved the fish ponds and gardens. The food is great (best breakfasts in our holiday) and the surf was really fun:) Mama does the best massages in Bali. The pool gets full sun so is a like a warm bath.,"September 17, 2016"
Nicole,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,1,8.4,very pleased we came and stayed here.,"September 05, 2016"
Vanessa,Italy,1 Bedroom Suite,3,8.0,"The location on the bay is simply astonishing, the beach is black volcanic with sparkling cristals inside, few people just a bunch of passionate surfers made it a perfect place to find peace and close relationship with nature. We spent there last 3 days of the holiday and it was really a regenerative time!","August 26, 2016"
Kristine,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,4,10.0,"We loved the beauty of the buildings, gardens and proximit to the beach. The innovative recycled timbers used in the construction and artistic driftwood sculptures in the garden walkways were a joy to be amongst. Staff were great and so was the food. Beach walks on literally empty sands and walking to the sound of birds only was a joy. Loved it!","July 31, 2016"
Elisa,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,5,9.6,"We will definitely return, the location, accommodation and staff were outstanding!","July 26, 2016"

jeremy,Australia,N/A,10,10.0,"We as a family had an awesome time,we were treated and looked after by the crew very well. The food was great and the beer was cold. It was a sad moment to leave yet will be back next year. If you're the type of family that enjoys kicking back,meeting others,surfing and creating your own adventure,this is a good place to be. If ya want night life, water parks,tattoo and sovioner places you best stay at Kuta.","June 10, 2016"
Phillip,Australia,1 Bedroom Suite,1,9.2,"We were not disappointed! Room was great , great surf, great staff, great guest, great locals,what more could you say other than it was great!

peter,Australia,N/A,5,9.3,Stayed  in August 2015  and  really enjoyed our stay  we stayed last year  as well the location is great  the surf right out the front   Quiet and relaxing as there is nothing to do  but relax. The staff friendly the food great if you want to get away from the hussell and bussell  for a couple of days this is the spot we will be back,"September 08, 2015"
joanne,Australia,N/A,1,8.0,Think this hotel probably has the best location if you are here to surf.  Rooms very clean and have traditional Bali themes with a bit of a modern surfer edge.  Only stayed one night as a stop over to East Bali.  But will be back to soak up some relaxed atmosphere.,"August 01, 2015"
Jade,Canada,N/A,3,7.7,"The loft is Tonnes of fun for groups and families. Nice patio, manicured lawns and the pool over looking Balian main break . It's the only place to stay in balian.","February 09, 2015"

michael,Australia,N/A,3,8.3,"This hotel is in the best location with Balian Beach break just out front. there is a great pool too relax by while you check out the surf. Not a lot to do around here but surf, yoga and relax. Try the extremely painful 'deep tissue' massage - hurts a lot but fixes all your aches and pains.","October 28, 2014"
Michael,Australia,N/A,3,8.3,Settled in very quickly. Pool and beach are great. More for surfers and couples. Not suitable for children. Loved it,"July 04, 2014"

Christopher,Australia,N/A,2,6.3,I stayed here in 2009 and loved it.  The only thing that seems to have changed is now its even busier. Still great place to stay. ... They shouldn't have got rid of the couches to chill on and watch surfing.,"May 26, 2014"
ed,Australia,N/A,2,8.7,"our stay in the ""happy house"" jogalo was perfect. right on the beach with great view of surf. 4 singles each had own bed with mossie curtains and heaps of room to move around in.not 5 star but perfect for our expectations and the rate, great value for budget surfer types . restaraunt provides good food and juices and the staff are switched on. the pool and gardens are perfect and you would be pretty fussy not to like the place.","March 06, 2013"
Nadine,United Kingdom,N/A,3,9.0,"Pros:

Remco,Netherlands,N/A,2,8.0,"Lovely location right on Balian beach, a popular surf spot which attracts both locals and quite a bunch of Australians. Our beach view room was spacious and clean, cold shower not an issue with the lovely temperatures during the day. 

Food at the restaurant/bar is good value for money and the staff is very helpful. 

We extended our stay with an extra night as we enjoyed an extra day hanging at the pool and chilling at the beach.","September 18, 2012"

Gross,France,1 Bedroom Suite,1,6.4,"Proche de la plage, petite maison en bois avec terrasse. La salle de bain est un peu noir et vert de moisissure et la chambre sent le renfermé.

Heike,Germany,1 Bedroom Suite,2,9.2,"Das einzige Resort in Balian Beach, das direkt unten am Strand liegt. Sehr schöne Anlage, wenn auch etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Wir haben uns extrem wohl gefühlt und mehrfach verlängert, weil wir gar nicht mehr weg wollten. Nur der Pool könnte etwas gepflegter sein. 
Ganz klare Empfehlung, vor allem zu Nebensaisonpreisen!","May 02, 2025"
Heike,Germany,1 Bedroom Suite,1,9.2,"Eine sehr schöne, gepflegte Anlage direkt am Strand. Ruhig, entspannt, ein Ort zum Verweilen! Der Pantai Balian ist traumhaft schön, allerdings kann man nicht wirklich schwimmen, nur im halbwegs flachen baden, da das Meer zu wild ist. Ein Muss für Surfer. Ansonsten kann man in der Umgebung allerdings nicht viel machen.. Wenn man einfach nur an einem tollen Ort entspannen möchte, ist es super!!!","May 18, 2025"
Ina,Germany,1 Bedroom Suite,3,8.0,"Wir sind direkt nach unserer Ankunft auf Bali in diesem Hotel für 3 Tage eingecheckt. Hauptgrund für uns war die direkte Strandlage da wir surfen gehen wollten und wurden nicht enttäuscht, die Wellen waren super und der Ausblick vom Pool war wunderbar. 
Die Anlage ist mit ihrer Pflanzenvielfalt sehr schön, allerdings sind im Pool ein paar Platten lose und das Wasser war sehr trüb.
Das Frühstück war lecker und es gab alles was man für einen guten Start in den Tag braucht.","October 12, 2023"
Katrin,Germany,1 Bedroom Suite,3,7.6,"Das Hotel liegt wunderschön am Pantai Balian. Als wir dort waren, waren wenig Hotelgäste dort,  das merkte man an der wenig besetzten Rezeption. Außerdem wurde unsere Buchung erst nicht gefunden. Vom Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war das Hotel etwas zu teuer - verglichen mit anderen Hotels, aber für zwei Tage ausspannen ist es herrlich.","September 25, 2025"
Nils,Germany,Villa (4 Adults),7,7.2,"Der Strand ist wundervoll. Leider nicht zum Baden geeignet. Man findet Muscheln und die Kinder können planschen. Es ist nicht überlaufen. Guter Strand für geübte Surfer. Die Strömung ist stark und die Wellen können beängstigend hoch werden. Ich als Anfänger war ziemlich überfordert. An einem Tag waren die Wellen kleiner und die See eher ruhig. Dann war es auch für mich als Anfänger möglich zu surfen. 
Die Anlage von Pondok Pitaya hat einen WUNDERVOLLEN GROSSEN GARTEN. Eine fantastische Yogashala. Wir hatten das letzte Haus neben vor Yogashala. Es war sehr geräumig. Tolle Terasse. Großes Bad. Leider hat der Abfluss meistens fast bis zur Unerträglichkeit gestunken. Der Boden und die Balken des Hauses waren ziemlich staubig.  Das Personal geht einfach ohne zu fragen rein zum reinigen und weckte an zwei Tagen unser Baby auf.  Der Pool ist schön. Achtung Infektionsgefahr! Habe Gehörgangsentzündung bekommen.","January 01, 2020"
Sabine,Switzerland,Villa (4 Adults),5,6.8,"Schön gelegen, Strand eignet sich nur zum spielen, zum schwimmen zuviel Strömung. Personal eher weniger engagiert und freundlich als an anderen Orten, aber oke. Yoga war gut. Ziemlich viele streunende Hunde die auch durchs Hotelgelände und Restaurant ziehen.  Einbisschen auf der teuren Seite für was geboten wird. Generell aber empfehlenswert.","August 16, 2017"

Marlon,Netherlands,1 Bedroom Suite,1,7.6,"Er is een hoop goeds te zeggen over deze accomodatie, de perfecte ligging , het super vriendelijke en meewerkende personeel, de mooie kamers maar we hadden meerdere keren problemen. De electiciteit die uitviel, een keer had het hele dorp een power cut maar de tweede keer was het een blok op het resort. We konden voor een prijsreductie verhuizen want de airco, verlichting en  wifi werkte niet. Maar deze kamer had ook problemen met de wifi en airconditioning.  Verder konden er bepaalde producten op de kaart niet gemaakt worden voor 3 dagen, terwijl er wel mee geadverteerd wordt. Als ze deze problemen oplossen zou het een goed resort zijn en zouden ze zeker een goede beoordeling krijgen.","January 03, 2024"
Birgit,Netherlands,1 Bedroom Suite,1,10.0,"We hebben hier maar 1 nachtje verbleven omdat we op doorreis waren maar wat hadden we achteraf spijt hiervan. Een prachtig Idylische kamer in Balinesche stijl met alle voorzieningen op en top. Prachtige tuin & zwembad. Vriendelijk personeel. Prijs / kwaliteit eten was ook goed. Wat een toplocatie aan zee! Uitstekend voor een weekje op resort met yoga, surfen & spa aan de deur. Bevelen dit verblijf aan iedereen aan!","September 29, 2018"
Elisa,Switzerland,1 Bedroom Suite,2,9.6,"Tivemos uma estadia curta de dois dias e o hotel é lindo, muito limpo, na frente da praia. Comida muito boa e barata no restaurante do hotel. A praia de balian é uma das únicas em Bali que tem ocorrência de ataques de tubarão por ter um rio na frente , por isso um pouco de atenção . Ficamos sem água uma noite , mas foi resolvido pela manhã . O staff muito adorável , incríveis! Bom hotel!","May 28, 2024"
